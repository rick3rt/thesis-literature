  abstract = {Although the use of ultrasonic plane-wave transmissions rather than line-per-line focused beam transmissions has been long studied in research, clinical application of this technology was only recently made possible through developments in graphical processing unit (GPU)-based platforms. Far beyond a technological breakthrough, the use of plane or diverging wave transmissions enables attainment of ultrafast frame rates (typically faster than 1000 frames per second) over a large field of view. This concept has also inspired the emergence of completely novel imaging modes which are valuable for ultrasound-based screening, diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring. In this review article, we present the basic principles and implementation of ultrafast imaging. In particular, present and future applications of ultrafast imaging in biomedical ultrasound are illustrated and discussed.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The short latency stretch reflex (SLR) is well described, but the stimulus that evokes the SLR remains elusive. One hypothesis states that reflex size is proportional to muscle fiber stretch, so in this study we examined the relationship between these 2 parameters in human triceps surae muscles. Methods: Achilles tendon taps and dorsiflexion stretches with different amplitudes and preactivation torques were applied to 6 participants while electromyography and muscle fascicle length changes were recorded in soleus and medial gastrocnemius (MG). Results: In response to tendon taps, neither fascicle length nor velocity changes were correlated with SLR size in either muscle, but accelerometer peaks were observed immediately after hammer\textendash{}tendon contact. Similar results were obtained after dorsiflexion stretches. Conclusion: Muscle fascicle stretch is poorly correlated with SLR size, regardless of perturbation parameters. We attribute the SLR trigger to the transmission of vibration through the lower limb, rather than muscle fiber stretch. Muscle Nerve 52: 245\textendash{}251, 2015},

  abstract = {Sudden stretch of active muscle typically results in two characteristic electromyographic responses: the short latency M1 and the long latency M2. The M1 response originates from the monosynaptic Ia afferent reflex pathway. The M2 response is less well understood and is likely a compound response to different afferent inputs mediated by spinal and transcortical pathways. In this study the possible contribution of the Ia afferent pathway to the M2 response was investigated. A mechanism was hypothesized in which the M1 response synchronizes the motoneurons, and therewith their refractory periods. Stretch perturbation experiments were performed on the wrist and results were compared with a computational model of a pool of motoneurons receiving tonic and Ia afferent input. The simulations showed the same stretch amplitude, velocity, and duration-dependent characteristics on the M2 as found experimentally. It was concluded that the stretch duration effect of the M2 likely originates from the proposed Ia afferent mediated mechanism.},

This algorithm was experimented on 16 healthy subjects (8 males and 8 females). The method makes possible the detection of the M1 \& M2 responses in single, individual trials, on a trial-by-trial basis. The novelty which the method brings consists in using only the time-domain to provide the real time detection of the M1 \& M2 in specific experimental closed loop paradigms, comparing to the complexity and time-consumption while using frequency/scale domains.},

  abstract = {The in vivo assessment of the biomechanical properties of the skeletal muscle is a complex issue because the muscle is an anisotropic, viscoelastic and dynamic medium. In this article, these mechanical properties are characterized for the brachialis muscle in vivo using a noninvasive ultrasound-based technique. This supersonic shear imaging technique combines an ultra-fast ultrasonic system and the remote generation of transient mechanical forces into tissue via the radiation force of focused ultrasonic beams. Such an ultrasonic radiation force is induced deep within the muscle by a conventional ultrasonic probe and the resulting shear waves are then imaged with the same probe (5 MHz) at an ultra-fast framerate (up to 5000 frames/s). Local tissue velocity maps are obtained with a conventional speckle tracking technique and provide a full movie of the shear wave propagation through the entire muscle. Shear wave group velocities are then estimated using a time of flight algorithm. This approach provides a complete set of quantitative and in vivo parameters describing the muscle's mechanical properties as a function of active voluntary contraction as well as passive extension of healthy volunteers. Anisotropic properties are also estimated by tilting the probe head with respects to the main muscular fibers direction. Finally, the dispersion of the shear waves is studied for these different configurations and shear modulus and shear viscosity are quantitatively assessed assuming the viscoelastic Voigt's model.

In this paper we report the use of ultrafast ultrasound imaging to explore with a submillimeter resolution the behavior of the contracting tissues \emph{in} \emph{vivo} (biceps brachii). To image the contraction, which is a very brief phenomenon ($<$100 ms), a recently designed ultrasound scanner prototype able to take up to 6000 frames/s was used. A very high frame rate from 1000 to 2500 frames/s was used to image the cross section plane of the muscle (transverse to fibers) enabling us to catch in real time the muscle contraction during a transient electrostimulation. Tissue velocities were obtained from radiofrequency based speckle tracking techniques and their profiles are discussed with respect to electrostimulation intensities and pulse repetition frequencies for different volunteers. Three-dimensional (3-D) very high frame rate movies were also acquired by repeating the experiment for different acquisition planes while triggering the imaging system with the electrostimulation device. The reconstructed 3-D velocity field allows the full localization of the contracting fibers bundle. This ultrasound technique, referred to as echo mechanomyography, offers new perspectives for in vivo and in situ noninvasive muscle diagnosis of an active contractile tissue.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns.},

In this study, we present the first implementation of Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging in 3D based on the use of either diverging or plane waves emanating from a sparse virtual array located behind the probe. It achieves high contrast and resolution while maintaining imaging rates of thousands of volumes per second. A customized portable ultrasound system was developed to sample 1024 independent channels and to drive a 32 \texttimes{} 32 matrix-array probe. Its ability to track in 3D transient phenomena occurring in the millisecond range within a single ultrafast acquisition was demonstrated for 3D Shear-Wave Imaging, 3D Ultrafast Doppler Imaging, and, finally, 3D Ultrafast combined Tissue and Flow Doppler Imaging. The propagation of shear waves was tracked in a phantom and used to characterize its stiffness. 3D Ultrafast Doppler was used to obtain 3D maps of Pulsed Doppler, Color Doppler, and Power Doppler quantities in a single acquisition and revealed, at thousands of volumes per second, the complex 3D flow patterns occurring in the ventricles of the human heart during an entire cardiac cycle, as well as the 3D in vivo interaction of blood flow and wall motion during the pulse wave in the carotid at the bifurcation. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D Ultrafast Ultrasound Imaging for the 3D mapping of stiffness, tissue motion, and flow in humans in vivo and promises new clinical applications of ultrasound with reduced intra\textemdash{}and inter-observer variability.},

With handling relatively soft, elastic objects, force and position are related and can be integrated to improve the accuracy of an estimate of either one. Sensory weighting between different sensory systems (e.g., vision and proprioception) has been extensively studied. This study investigated whether similar weighting can be found within the proprioceptive sensory system, more specifically between the modalities force and position. We hypothesized that sensory weighting is governed by object stiffness: position feedback is weighted heavier on soft objects (large deflections), while force feedback is weighted heavier on stiff objects (small deflections). Subjects were instructed to blindly reproduce either position or force while holding a one degree of freedom haptic manipulator that simulated a linear spring with one of four predetermined stiffnesses. In catch trials the spring was covertly replaced by a nonlinear spring. The difference in force ($\Delta$F) and position ($\Delta$X) between the regular and the catch trials revealed the sensory weighting between force and position feedback. A maximum likelihood estimation model predicted that: (1) task instruction did not affect the outcome measures, and (2) force feedback is weighted heavier with increasing object stiffness as was hypothesized. Both effects were found experimentally, and the subjects' sensory weighting closely resembled the optimal model predictions. To conclude, this study successfully demonstrated sensory weighting within the proprioceptive system.},

  abstract = {The dynamic behavior of a neuromusculoskeletal system results from the complex mechanical interaction between muscle visco-elasticity resulting from (co-)contraction and afferent feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. As a result of the multiple interactions the individual effect of each of the structures to the overall dynamics is hard to recognize, if not impossible. Here a neuromuscular control (NMC) model is developed to analyze the functional contribution of the various physiological structures on the mechanical behavior of a limb. The dynamics of a joint are presented in admittances, i.e. the dynamic relation between input force (or torque) and the output displacement, which can be represented by either frequency or impulse response functions. With the model it can be shown that afferent feedback reduces, while muscle visco-elasticity increases, the stability margins. This implicates that there is a delicate balance between muscle co-contraction and afferent feedback, which depends on the joint specific physiological properties. The main application of the model is educational; it is implemented in a graphical user interface allowing users to explore the role of the various physiological structures on joint dynamics. Other applications of the model are more experimental, e.g. to elucidate experimentally measured admittances and to compare the quantified parameter values with the theoretically optimal ones. It is concluded that the NMC model is a useful and intuitive tool to investigate human motor control, in a theoretical as well as an experimental way.},

An important component of this system, the 'muscle spindle', is a complex sensor that responds to imposed length changes and is thought to provide information which is important in the control of movement and in the maintenance of posture. The structure of the muscle spindle and its response to various inputs are described. The multi-input and multi-output nature and non-linear behaviour of the muscle spindle are emphasised, both in terms of continuous and pulse- coded quantities. The methods of pre-processing of pulse-coded signals from nerves, and the identification techniques currently applied by neurophysiologists for the estimation of the parameters of linearised models of the muscle spindle, are presented and assessed. New developments in the identification of point-process systems are shown to be applicable to some aspects of muscle-spindle behaviour. This approach, based upon point-process parameters, is applied to an analysis of the output signal of a muscle spindle under a variety of input conditions and to the estimation of a transfer function of the muscle spindle subjected to a point-process input. A description of one non-linearity and the effects of an additional input are also presented.},

  abstract = {. In this study we have examined the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to use spinal reflexes to minimize displacements during postural control while continuous force perturbations were applied at the hand. The subjects were instructed to minimize the displacements of the hand from a reference position that resulted from the force perturbations. The perturbations were imposed in one direction by means of a hydraulic manipulator of which the virtual mass and damping were varied. Resistance to the perturbations came from intrinsic and reflexive stiffness, and from the virtual environment. It is hypothesized that reflexive feedback during posture maintenance is optimally adjusted such that position deviations are minimal for a given virtual environment. Frequency response functions were estimated, capturing all mechanical properties of the arm at the end point (hand) level. Intrinsic and reflexive parameters were quantified by fitting a linear neuromuscular model to the frequency responses. The reflexive length feedback gain increased strongly with damping and little with the eigenfrequency of the total combined system (i.e. arm plus environment). The reflexive velocity feedback gain decreased slightly with relative damping at the largest eigenfrequency and more markedly at smaller eigenfrequencies. In the case of highest reflex gains, the total system remained stable and sufficiently damped while the responses of only the arm were severely underdamped and sometimes even unstable. To further analyse these results, a model optimization was performed. Intrinsic and reflexive parameters were optimized such that two criterion functions were minimized. The first concerns performance and penalized hand displacements from a reference point. The second one weights afferent control effort to avoid inefficient feedback. The simulations showed good similarities with the estimated values. Length feedback was adequately predicted by the model for all conditions. The predicted velocity feedback gains were larger in all cases, probably indicating a mutual gain limiting relation between length and velocity afferent signals. The results suggest that both reflex gains seem to be adjusted by the CNS, where in particular the length feedback gain was optimal so as to maximize performance at minimum control effort.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design of a torque-controlled manipulator to identify the dynamics of the wrist joint. With torque disturbances, the subject can actively control the joint angle, giving a natural task. The application of a hybrid haptic controller guarantees linearity over a large bandwidth and adjustable virtual dynamics. The haptic controller has a bandwidth of 50\,Hz, meaning that the virtual dynamics are realistically felt at up to 50\,Hz. To let the subject `feel' the torque, disturbances as well as possible the apparent, or virtual, dynamics of the device must be small. The minimal apparent inertia of the device is 1.6\,g\,m2, which is of the same order as for a normal wrist, and the minimal damping and stiffness are negligible. To judge the accuracy of the manipulator, loads of known physical properties were attached and their parameters were quantified. The parameters of the loads were estimated with a maximum error of 5\%. As the eigenfrequency of a (co)-contracted human wrist is approximately 15\,Hz, the 50-Hz bandwidth of the haptic device is sufficient to measure all relevant dynamics of the human wrist. With this device, the dynamics of the human wrist joint can be measured under varying virtual dynamics, as well as the effect of neurological dysfunction on human motor control, for example.},

  abstract = {This study presents a new multivariable closed-loop identification technique for estimating the dynamic compliance of the multijoint human arm during posture maintenance. The method is designed for the application of continuous force disturbances that facilitate interaction of the limb with the environment. The dynamic compliance of the arm arises from different physiological mechanisms and is important for maintaining stable postures and to suppress disturbances. Estimates can be useful to analyze the ability of the nervous system to adapt the arm compliance to different types of disturbances and environments. The technique is linear and requires no a priori knowledge of the system. Linear system behavior is justified for posture tasks where the hand position deviates slightly from a reference position. Interaction results in a closed-loop configuration of arm and environment. The problem with previous methods is the restriction to open-loop systems. With the current technique, the dynamic arm compliance is separately estimated from the closed-loop. The accuracy of the identification technique is tested by simulations for different values of the dynamic compliance of the arm and environment and for different methodological parameters. It is concluded that the identification technique is accurate, even for short observation periods and severe noise.},

Most human motion control studies either isolate only one contributor, or assume that relevant reflexive feedback pathways during voluntary disturbance rejection tasks originate mainly from the muscle spindle. Human ankle-control experiments were performed, using three task instructions and three perturbation characteristics to evoke a wide range of responses to force perturbations. During position tasks, subjects (n = 10) resisted the perturbations, becoming more stiff than when being relaxed (i.e., the relax task). During force tasks, subjects were instructed to minimize force changes and actively gave way to imposed forces, thus becoming more compliant than during relax tasks. Subsequently, linear physiological models were fitted to the experimental data. Inhibitory, as well as excitatory force feedback, was needed to account for the full range of measured experimental behaviors. In conclusion, force feedback plays an important role in the studied motion control tasks (excitatory during position tasks and inhibitory during force tasks), implying that spindle-mediated feedback is not the only significant adaptive system that contributes to the maintenance of posture or force.},

More recently, the motor system has been subject to quantitative and computational characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control processes from computational models and map them onto specific deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum, parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe. We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization, prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with sensory states and estimating the ``cost-to-go'' during execution of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.},

Disturbance experiments were carried out on human subjects using continuous random force inputs. The task instruction was `minimize displacements', prescribing a maximum performance task. For the separation of intrinsic and reflexive components, system identification in the frequency domain is applied. From the time records of position and force, frequency response functions (FRFs) are estimated. Given a model structure and an appropriate estimate of the intrinsic component, an estimate of the reflex gains for length and velocity are obtained from the FRFs. The feedback gains vary considerably with the frequency content of the disturbance signal. The results show that reflexive dynamics are substantial for narrow-band and especially low-frequency input signals. It is likely that high reflex gains are most effective for low-frequency inputs ($<$3 Hz) that do not excite the closed-loop system's eigenfrequency. Also significant negative reflex gains are estimated for near-sinusoidal inputs ($>$1.5 Hz). It is concluded that this new methodology can offer interesting insights into the ability of the central nervous system to modulate reflexive feedback gains.},

  abstract = {Tendon properties contribute to the complex interaction of the central nervous system, muscle\textendash{}tendon unit and bony structures to produce joint movement. Until recently limited information on human tendon behaviour in vivo was available; however, novel methodological advancements have enabled new insights to be gained in this area. The present review summarizes the progress made with respect to human tendon and aponeurosis function in vivo, and how tendons adapt to ageing, loading and unloading conditions. During low tensile loading or with passive lengthening not only the muscle is elongated, but also the tendon undergoes significant length changes, which may have implications for reflex responses. During active loading, the length change of the tendon far exceeds that of the aponeurosis, indicating that the aponeurosis may more effectively transfer force onto the tendon, which lengthens and stores elastic energy subsequently released during unloading, in a spring-like manner. In fact, data recently obtained in vivo confirm that, during walking, the human Achilles tendon provides elastic strain energy that can decrease the energy cost of locomotion. Also, new experimental evidence shows that, contrary to earlier beliefs, the metabolic activity in human tendon is remarkably high and this affords the tendon the ability to adapt to changing demands. With ageing and disuse there is a reduction in tendon stiffness, which can be mitigated with resistance exercises. Such adaptations seem advantageous for maintaining movement rapidity, reducing tendon stress and risk of injury, and possibly, for enabling muscles to operate closer to the optimum region of the length\textendash{}tension relationship.},

The displacements of the TA tendon origin from rest to all contraction intensities were normalized to tendon length to obtain strain values. From the data obtained, the tendon force-displacement and stress-strain relationships were determined and the tendon stiffness and Young's modulus were calculated. 4 Tendon force and stress increased curvilinearly as a function of displacement and strain, respectively. The tendon force and displacement at maximum isometric load were 530 N and 4$\cdot$1 mm, and the corresponding stress and strain values were 25 MPa and 2$\cdot$5\%, respectively. The tendon stiffness and Young's modulus at maximum isometric load were 161 N mm-1 and 1$\cdot$2 GPa, respectively. These results are in agreement with previous reports on in vitro testing of isolated tendons and suggest that under physiological loading the TA tendon operates within the elastic `toe' region.},

The SWUE on the muscle and tendon should be performed with the lightest transducer's pressure, a shorter acquisition time for the SWUE sonogram, while measuring the mean elastic modulus regardless the ROI's size.},

  abstract = {Background Estimation of an individual muscle force still remains one of the main challenges in biomechanics. In this way, the present study aimed: (1) to determine whether an elastography technique called Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) could be used to estimate muscle force, (2) to compare this estimation to that one provided by surface electromyography (EMG), and (3) to determine the effect of the pennation of muscle fibers on the accuracy of the estimation. Methods and Results Eleven subjects participated in two experimental sessions; one was devoted to the shear elastic modulus measurements and the other was devoted to the EMG recordings. Each session consisted in: (1) two smooth linear torque ramps from 0 to 60\% and from 0 to 30\% of maximal voluntary contraction, for the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor digiti minimi, respectively (referred to as ``ramp contraction''); (2) two contractions done with the instruction to freely change the torque (referred to as ``random changes contraction''). Multi-channel surface EMG recordings were obtained from a linear array of eight electrodes and the shear elastic modulus was measured using SSI. For ramp contractions, significant linear relationships were reported between EMG activity level and torque (R2 = 0.949$\pm$0.036), and between shear elastic modulus and torque (R2 = 0.982$\pm$0.013). SSI provided significant lower RMSdeviation between measured torque and estimated torque than EMG activity level for both types of contraction (1.4$\pm$0.7 vs. 2.8$\pm$1.4\% of maximal voluntary contraction for ``ramp contractions'', p$<$0.01; 4.5$\pm$2.3 vs. 7.9$\pm$5.9\% of MVC for ``random changes contractions'', p$<$0.05). No significant difference was reported between muscles. Conclusion The shear elastic modulus measured using SSI can provide a more accurate estimation of individual muscle force than surface EMG. In addition, pennation of muscle fibers does not influence the accuracy of the estimation.},

Shear wave velocity (SWV, an index of tissue elasticity) was measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography in a relaxed (passive) state, confirmed by electromyography.ResultsSWV of the patellar tendon and quadriceps muscles increased with knee flexion (longer muscle\textendash{}tendon unit; P $<$ 0.001). Within the proximal third of the patellar tendon, SWV was lower in the posterior than anterior region at 70$^\circ$ (P = 0.002) and 85$^\circ$ (P $<$ 0.001), but not at 25$^\circ$, 40$^\circ$ or 55$^\circ$ (region-by-angle interaction, P = 0.007). No differences were found between anterior and posterior regions within the middle third of the patellar tendon (P = 0.332). For the quadriceps muscles, a significant muscle-by-angle (P $<$ 0.001) interaction was also observed. SWV of VL was greater than VM at 55$^\circ$ (P = 0.005), 70$^\circ$ (P = 0.001) and 85$^\circ$ (P $<$ 0.001), but not at 25$^\circ$ or 40$^\circ$. SWV of RF was lower than VL at all angles (all P $<$ 0.002) and lower than VM at 55$^\circ$, 70$^\circ$ and 85$^\circ$ (all P $<$ 0.002).ConclusionsPassive knee flexion at and beyond 70$^\circ$ was associated with non-uniform elastic properties within the proximal patellar tendon and between individual quadriceps muscles.

Sixty-seven participants (22 Achilles tendinopathy, 17 patellar tendinopathy, and 28 healthy controls) were recruited between March 2015 and March 2016. Shear wave velocity (SWV), an index of tissue elastic modulus, and tendon thickness were measured bilaterally at mid-tendon and insertional regions of Achilles and patellar tendons by an examiner blinded to group. Analysis of covariance, adjusted for age, body mass index, and sex was used to compare differences in tendon thickness and SWV between the two tendinopathy groups (relative to controls) and regions. Tendon thickness was included as a covariate for analysis of SWV. Compared to controls, participants with Achilles tendinopathy had lower SWV at the distal insertion (Mean difference MD; 95\% CI: -1.56; -2.49 to -0.62 m/s; P $<$ .001) and greater thickness at the mid-tendon (MD 0.19; 0.05-0.33 cm; P = .007). Compared to controls, participants with patellar tendinopathy had higher SWV at both regions (MD 1.25; 0.40-2.10 m/s; P = .005) and greater thickness proximally (MD 0.17; 0.06-0.29 cm; P = .003). Compared to controls, participants with Achilles and patellar tendinopathy displayed lower Achilles tendon elastic modulus and higher patellar tendon elastic modulus, respectively. More research is needed to explore whether maturation, aging, or chronic load underlie these findings and whether current management programs for Achilles and patellar tendinopathy need to be tailored to the tendon.},

  abstract = {A goal and challenge in neuromechanical modeling is to develop validated simulations to predict the effects of neuromotor deficits and therapies on movements. This has been particularly challenging in balance and locomotion because they are inherently unstable, making it difficult to explore model parameters in a way that still coordinates the body in a functional way. Integrating realistic and validated musculoskeletal models with neural control mechanisms is critical to our ability to predict how human robustly move in the environment. Here we briefly review both human locomotion models, which generally focus on modeling the physical dynamics of movement with simplified models of neural control, as well as balance models, which model sensorimotor dynamics and processing with simplified biomechanical models. Combining complex neural and musculoskeletal models increases the redundancy in a model and allows us to study how motor variability and robustness are exploited to produce movements in both healthy and impaired individuals. To advance, the integration of neuromechanical modeling and experimental approaches will be critical in testing specific hypotheses concerning how and why neuromechanical flexibility is both exploited and constrained under various movement contexts. We give a few examples of how the close interplay between models and experiments can reveal neuromechanical principles of movement.},

Consequently, the linearly estimated model parameters will depend on properties of the applied perturbation properties (such perturbation amplitude and velocity). We aimed to systematically address the effects of perturbation velocity on linearly estimated neuromechanical parameters. Using a single axis manipulator ramp and hold perturbations were applied to the wrist joint. Effects of perturbation velocity (0.5, 1 and 3 rad/s) were investigated at multiple background torque levels (0, 0.5 and 1 N$\cdot$m). With increasing perturbation velocity, estimated joint stiffness remained constant, while damping and reflex gain decreased. This variation in model parameters is dependent on background torque levels, i.e. muscle contraction. These observations support the future development of nonlinear models that are capable of describing wrist joint behavior over a larger range of loading conditions, exceeding the restricted range of operation that is required for linearization.},

  abstract = {Progress in diagnosis and treatment of movement disorders after neurological diseases like stroke, cerebral palsy, dystonia and at old age requires understanding of the altered capacity to adequately respond to physical obstacles in the environment. With posture and movement disorders, the control of muscles is hampered, resulting in aberrant force generation and improper impedance regulation. Understanding of this improper regulation not only requires the understanding of the role of the neural controller, but also attention for the 1) the interaction between the neural controller and the ``plant'', comprising the biomechanical properties of the skeleton including the viscoelastic properties of the contractile (muscle) and non-contractile (connective) tissues: neuromechanics and 2) the closed loop nature of neural controller and biomechanical system in which cause and effect interact and are hence difficult to separate. Properties of the neural controller and the biomechanical system need to be addressed synchronously by the combination of haptic robotics, (closed loop) system identification, and neuro-mechanical modelling. In this paper, we argue that assessment of neuromechanics in response to well defined environmental conditions and tasks may provide for key parameters to understand posture and movement disorders in neurological diseases and as biomarkers to increase accuracy of prediction models for functional outcome and effects of intervention.},

A systematic review was performed, and studies were classified according to American Academy of Neurology criteria for rating articles of diagnostic accuracy (question 1) and for screening articles (question 2). Results: Neuromuscular ultrasound measurement of median nerve cross-sectional area at the wrist is accurate and may be offered as a diagnostic test for CTS (Level A).

        Objective.~Comparison of the timing of onset of lateral abdominal muscle activity during rapid arm movements in patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (cLBP) and back-pain-free controls.
        Summary of Background Data.~Rapid movements of the arm are normally associated with prior activation of trunk-stabilizing muscles in readiness for the impending postural perturbation. Using invasive intramuscular electromyography techniques, studies have shown that this feed-forward function is delayed in some patients with low back pain (LBP). Ultrasound tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) provides an ultrasound method for quantifying muscle activation in a noninvasive manner, allowing investigation of larger groups of patients and controls.
        Methods.~Ninety-six individuals participated (48 patients with cLBP and 48 matched LBP-free controls). During rapid shoulder flexion, abduction, and extension, surface electromyographic signals from the deltoid and motion-mode TDI images from the contralateral lateral abdominal muscles were recorded simultaneously. The onset of muscle activity was given by changes in the tissue velocity of the abdominal muscles, as measured with TDI. Pain and disability in the patients were assessed using standardized questionnaires. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance.
        Results.~In both groups, feed-forward activity of the lateral abdominal muscles was recorded during arm movements in all directions. The main effect of ``group membership'' revealed no significant difference between the groups for the earliest onset of abdominal muscle activity (P = 0.398). However, a significant ``group \texttimes{} body side'' interaction (P = 0.015) was observed, and this was the result of earlier onsets in the cLBP group than controls for the abdominal muscles on the right (but not left) body side. No relationship was found between the time of onset of the earliest abdominal muscle activity and pain intensity, pain frequency, pain medication usage, or Roland Morris disability scores.
        Conclusion.~Patients with cLBP did not show a delayed onset of feed-forward activation of the lateral abdominal muscles during rapid arm movements. Earlier activation was observed for one body side compared with the controls. However, the clinical relevance of this finding remains obscure, especially because there was no relationship between the onset of activation and any clinical parameters.},

  abstract = {Objective. To determine whether the human Achilles tendon has higher material properties than other tendons and to test for strain rate sensitivity of the tendon. Design. Mechanical testing of excised tendons. Background. While the human Achilles tendon appears to experience higher in vivo stresses than other tendons, it is not known how the Achilles tendon's material properties compare with the properties of other tendons. Methods. Modulus, failure stress, and failure strain were measured for excised human Achilles tendons loaded at strain rates of 1\% s-1 and 10\% s-1. Paired t-tests were used to examine strain rate effects, and average properties from grouped data were used to compare the Achilles tendon's properties with properties reported in the literature for other tendons. Results. Failure stress and failure strain were higher at the faster strain rate, but no significant difference in modulus was observed. At the 1\% s-1rate, the mean modulus and failure stress were 816 MPa (SD, 218) and 71 MPa (SD, 17), respectively. The failure strain was 12.8\% (SD, 1.7) for the bone-tendon complex and 7.5\% (SD, 1.1) for the tendon substance. At the 10\% s-1 rate, the mean modulus and failure stress were 822 MPa (SD, 211) and 86 MPa (SD, 24), respectively. The mean failure strain was 16.1\% (SD, 3.6) for the bone-tendon complex and 9.9\% (SD, 1.9) for the tendon substance. These properties fall within the range of properties reported in the literature for other tendons. Conclusions. The material properties of the human Achilles tendon measured in this study are similar to the properties of other tendons reported in the literature despite higher stresses imposed on the Achilles tendon in vivo.Relevance The human Achilles tendon does not adapt to high in vivo stresses by developing correspondingly high material properties. This leaves the tendon at an increased risk of injury and may help to explain the high incidence of Achilles tendon injuries.},

  abstract = {Humans control their movements using adaptive proprioceptive feedback from muscle afferents. The interaction between proprioceptive reflexes and biomechanical properties of the limb is essential in understanding the etiology of movement disorders. A non-linear neuromuscular model of the wrist incorporating muscle dynamics and neural control was developed to test hypotheses on fixed dystonia. Dystonia entails sustained muscle contractions resulting in abnormal postures. Lack of inhibition is often hypothesized to result in hyperreflexia (exaggerated reflexes), which may cause fixed dystonia. In this study the model-simulated behavior in case of several abnormal reflex settings was compared to the clinical features of dystonia: abnormal posture, sustained muscle contraction, increased stiffness, diminished voluntary control and activity-aggravation. The simulation results were rated to criteria based on characteristic features of dystonia. Three abnormal reflex scenarios were tested: (1) increased reflex sensitivity\textemdash{}increased sensitivity of both the agonistic and antagonistic reflex pathways; (2) imbalanced reflex offset\textemdash{}a static offset to the reflex pathways on the agonistic side only; and (3) imbalanced reflex sensitivity\textemdash{}increased sensitivity of only the agonistic reflex pathways. Increased reflex sensitivity did not fully account for the features of dystonia, despite distinct motor dysfunction, since no abnormal postures occurred. Although imbalanced reflex offset did result in an abnormal posture, it could not satisfy other criteria. Nevertheless, imbalanced reflex sensitivity with unstable force feedback in one of the antagonists closely resembled all features of dystonia. The developed neuromuscular model is an effective tool to test hypotheses on the underlying pathophysiology of movement disorders.},

  abstract = {The use of brightness-mode ultrasound and Doppler ultrasound in physical medicine and rehabilitation has increased dramatically. The continuing evolution of ultrasound technology has also produced ultrasound elastography, a cutting-edge technology that can directly measure the mechanical properties of tissue, including muscle stiffness. Its real-time and direct measurements of muscle stiffness can aid the diagnosis and rehabilitation of acute musculoskeletal injuries and chronic myofascial pain. It can also help monitor outcomes of interventions affecting muscle in neuromuscular and musculoskeletal diseases, and it can better inform the functional prognosis. This technology has implications for even broader use of ultrasound in physical medicine and rehabilitation practice, but more knowledge about its uses and limitations is essential to its appropriate clinical implementation. In this review, we describe different ultrasound elastography techniques for studying muscle stiffness, including strain elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, and shear-wave elastography. We discuss the basic principles of these techniques, including the strengths and limitations of their measurement capabilities. We review the current muscle research, discuss physiatric clinical applications of these techniques, and note directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Limited diffraction beams have a large depth of field and have many potential applications. Recently, a new method (Fourier method) was developed with limited diffraction beams for image construction. With the method and a single plane wave transmission, both 2D (two-dimensional) and 3D (three-dimensional) images of a very high frame rate (up to 3750 frames/s for a depth of 200 mm in biological soft tissues) and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be constructed with relatively simple and inexpensive hardware. If limited diffraction beams of different parameters are used in both transmission and reception and transducer aperture is shaded with a cosine function, high-resolution and low-sidelobe images can be constructed with the new method without montage of multiple frames of images [the image quality is comparable to that obtained with a transmit-receive (two-way) dynamically focused imaging system]. In this paper, the Fourier method was studied with both experiment and computer simulation for 2D B-mode imaging. In the experiment, two commercial broadband 1D array transducers (48 and 64 elements) of different aperture sizes (18.288 and 38.4 mm) and center frequencies (2.25 and 2.5 MHz) were used to construct images of different viewing sizes. An ATS539 tissue-equivalent phantom of an average frequency-dependent attenuation of 0.5 dB/MHz/cm was used as a test object. To obtain high frame rate images, a single plane wave pulse (broadband) was transmitted with the arrays. Echoes received with the arrays were processed with both the Fourier and conventional dynamic focusing (delay-and-sum) methods to construct 2D B-mode images. Results show that the quality (resolution and contrast) of constructed images is virtually identical for both methods, except that the Fourier method is simpler to implement. Both methods have also a similar sensitivity to phase aberration distortions. Excellent agreement among theory, simulation, and experiment was obtained.},

  abstract = {Conventional ultrasound systems acquire ultrasound data sequentially one image line at a time. The architecture of these systems is therefore also sequential in nature and processes most of the data in a sequential pipeline. This often makes it difficult to implement radically different imaging strategies on the platforms and makes the scanners less accessible for research purposes. A system designed for imaging research flexibility is the prime concern. The possibility of sending out arbitrary signals and the storage of data from all transducer elements for 5 to 10 seconds allows clinical evaluation of synthetic aperture and 3D imaging. This paper describes a real-time system specifically designed for research purposes. The system can acquire multichannel data in real-time from multi-element ultrasound transducers, and can perform some real-time processing on the acquired data. The system is capable of performing real-time beamforming for conventional imaging methods using linear, phased, and convex arrays. Image acquisition modes can be intermixed, and this makes it possible to perform initial trials in a clinical environment with new imaging modalities for synthetic aperture imaging, 2D and 3D B-mode, and velocity imaging using advanced coded emissions. The system can be used with 128-element transducers and can excite 128 transducer elements and receive and sample data from 64 channels simultaneously at 40 MHz with 12-bit precision. Two-to-one multiplexing in receive can be used to cover 128 receive channels. Data can be beamformed in real time using the system's 80 signal processing units, or it can be stored directly in RAM. The system has 16 Gbytes RAM and can, thus, store more than 3.4 seconds of multichannel data. It is fully software programmable and its signal processing units can also be reconfigured under software control. The control of the system is done over a 100-Mbits/s Ethernet using C and Matlab. Programs for doing, e.g., B-mode imaging can be written directly in Matlab and executed on the system over the net from any workstation running Matlab. The overall system concept is presented along with its implementation and examples of B-mode and in vivo synthetic aperture flow imaging.},

  doi = {10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1067},
  abstract = {The emergence of ultrafast frame rates in ultrasonic imaging has been recently made possible by the development of new imaging modalities such as transient elastography. Data acquisition rates reaching more than thousands of images per second enable the real-time visualization of shear mechanical waves propagating in biological tissues, which convey information about local viscoelastic properties of tissues. The first proposed approach for reaching such ultrafast frame rates consists of transmitting plane waves into the medium. However, because the beamforming process is then restricted to the receive mode, the echographic images obtained in the ultrafast mode suffer from a low quality in terms of resolution and contrast and affect the robustness of the transient elastography mode. It is here proposed to improve the beamforming process by using a coherent recombination of compounded plane-wave transmissions to recover high-quality echographic images without degrading the high frame rate capabilities. A theoretical model is derived for the comparison between the proposed method and the conventional B-mode imaging in terms of contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, and resolution. Our model predicts that a significantly smaller number of insonifications, 10 times lower, is sufficient to reach an image quality comparable to conventional B-mode. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by in vitro experiments performed in tissue-mimicking phantoms. Such results raise the appeal of coherent compounds for use with standard imaging modes such as B-mode or color flow. Moreover, in the context of transient elastography, ultrafast frame rates can be preserved while increasing the image quality compared with flat insonifications. Improvements on the transient elastography mode are presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Coherent plane wave compounding is a promising technique for achieving very high frame rate imaging without compromising image quality or penetration. However, this approach relies on the hypothesis that the imaged object is not moving during the compounded scan sequence, which is not the case in cardiovascular imaging. This work investigates the effect of tissue motion on retrospective transmit focusing in coherent compounded plane wave imaging (PWI). Two compound scan sequences were studied based on a linear and alternating sequence of tilted plane waves, with different timing characteristics. Simulation studies revealed potentially severe degradations in the retrospective focusing process, where both radial and lateral resolution was reduced, lateral shifts of the imaged medium were introduced, and losses in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were inferred. For myocardial imaging, physiological tissue displacements were on the order of half a wavelength, leading to SNR losses up to 35 dB, and reductions of contrast by 40 dB. No significant difference was observed between the different tilt sequences. A motion compensation technique based on cross-correlation was introduced, which significantly recovered the losses in SNR and contrast for physiological tissue velocities. Worst case losses in SNR and contrast were recovered by 35 dB and 27\textendash{}35 dB, respectively. The effects of motion were demonstrated in vivo when imaging a rat heart. Using PWI, very high frame rates up to 463 fps were achieved at high image quality, but a motion correction scheme was then required.},

  abstract = {Time reversal of ultrasonic fields represents a way to focus through an inhomogeneous medium. This may be accomplished by a time-reversal mirror (TRM) made from an array of transmit-receive transducers that respond linearly and allow the incident acoustic pressure to be sampled. The pressure field is then time-reversed and re-emitted. This process can be used to focus through inhomogeneous media on a reflective target that behaves as an acoustic source after being insonified. The time-reversal approach is introduced in a discussion of the classical techniques used for focusing pulsed waves through inhomogeneous media (adaptive time-delay techniques). Pulsed wave time-reversal focusing is shown using reciprocity valid in inhomogeneous medium to be optimal in the sense that it realizes the spatial-temporal matched filter to the inhomogeneous propagation transfer function between the array and the target. The research on time-reversed wave fields has also led to the development of new concepts that are described: time-reversal cavity that extends the concept of the TRM, and iterative time-reversal processing for automatic sorting of targets according to their reflectivity and resonating of extended targets.$<$$>$},

  abstract = {In this study, a multidimensional strain estimation method using biplane ultrasound is presented to assess local relative deformation (i.e., local strain) in three orthogonal directions in skeletal muscles during induced and voluntary contractions. The method was tested in the musculus biceps brachii of five healthy subjects for three different types of muscle contraction: 1) excitation of the muscle with a single electrical pulse via the musculocutaneous nerve, resulting in a so-called ``twitch'' contraction; 2) a train of five pulses at 10 Hz and 20 Hz, respectively, to obtain a submaximum tetanic contraction; and 3) voluntary contractions at 30, 60, and 100\% of maximum contraction force. Results show that biplane ultrasound strain imaging is feasible. The method yielded adequate performance using the radio frequency data in tracking the tissue motion and enabled the measurement of local deformation in both the vertical direction (orthogonal to the arm) and in the horizontal directions (parallel and perpendicular to direction of the arm) in two orthogonal cross sections of the muscle. The twitch experiments appeared to be reproducible in all three directions, and high strains in vertical (25 to 30\%) and horizontal (-20\% to -10\%) directions were measured. Visual inspection of both the ultrasound data, as well as the strain data, revealed a relaxation that was significantly slower than the force decay. The pulse train experiments nicely illustrated the performance of our technique: 1) similar patterns of force and strain waveforms were found; and 2) each stimulation frequency yielded a different strain pattern, e.g., peak vertical strain was 40\% during 10-Hz stimulation and 60\% during 20-Hz stimulation. The voluntary contraction patterns were found to be both practically feasible and reproducible, which will enable muscles and more natural contraction patterns to be examined without the need of electrical stimulation.},

In this work, we have developed a novel beamformer architecture with the real-time parallel processing capacity needed to enable fast realization of PW compounding and SA imaging. The beamformer hardware comprises an array of graphics processing units (GPUs) that are hosted within the same computer workstation. Their parallel computational resources are controlled by a pixel-based software processor that includes the operations of analytic signal conversion, delay-and-sum beamforming, and recursive compounding as required to generate images from the channel-domain data samples acquired using PW compounding and SA imaging principles. When using two GTX-480 GPUs for beamforming and one GTX-470 GPU for recursive compounding, the beamformer can compute compounded 512 \texttimes{} 255 pixel PW and SA images at throughputs of over 4700 fps and 3000 fps, respectively, for imaging depths of 5 cm and 15 cm (32 receive channels, 40 MHz sampling rate). Its processing capacity can be further increased if additional GPUs or more advanced models of GPU are used.},

A less-studied concern in ultrasound beamforming is the deleterious contribution of bright off-axis targets. This paper describes a new approach, the constrained adaptive beamformer (CAB), which builds on classic array processing methods from radar and sonar. Given a desired frequency response for the mainlobe beam, the CAB reduces off-axis signals by imposing an optimal set of weights on the receive aperture. A linearly constrained adaptive filter dynamically adjusts the aperture weights in response to the incoming data. Initial results show a factor of two improvement in point target resolution and a 60\% contrast improvement for low echogenicity cysts. The CAB could considerably improve cardiac and abdominal image quality. We address implementation issues and discuss future work.},

  abstract = {A minimum variance (MV) approach for nearfield beamforming of broadband data is proposed. The approach is implemented in the frequency domain, and it provides a set of adapted, complex apodization weights for each frequency subband. The performance of the proposed MV beamformer is tested on simulated data obtained using Field II. The method is validated using synthetic aperture data and data obtained from a plane wave emission. Data for 13 point targets and a circular cyst with a radius of 5 mm are simulated. The performance of the MV beamformer is compared with delay-and-sum (DS) using boxcar weights and Hanning weights and is quantified by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the peak-side-lobe level (PSL). Single emission DS boxcar, DS Hanning, MV provide a PSL of -16, -36, -49 dB and a FWHM of 0.79, 1.33, 0.08 mm. Using all 128 emissions, DS boxcar, DS Hanning, MV provides a PSL of -32, -49, -65 dB, and a FWHM of 0.63, 0.97, 0.08 mm. The contrast of the beamformed single emission responses of the circular cyst was calculated as -18, -37, -40 dB. The simulations have shown that the frequency subband MV beamformer provides a significant increase in lateral resolution compared with DS, even when using considerably fewer emissions. An increase in resolution is seen when using only one single emission. Furthermore, the effect of steering vector errors is investigated. The steering vector errors are investigated by applying an error of the sound speed estimate to the ultrasound data. As the error increases, it is seen that the MV beamformer is not as robust compared with the DS beamformer with boxcar and Hanning weights. Nevertheless, it is noted that the DS does not outperform the MV beamformer. For errors of 2\% and 4\% of the correct value, the FWHM are 0.81, 1.25, 0.34 mm and 0.89, 1.44, 0.46 mm, respectively.},

  abstract = {Background: Monitoring the accumulation of microbubbles within tissue vasculature with ultrasound allows both molecular and perfusion imaging. Unfortunately, conventional imaging with focused pulses can destroy a large fraction of the microbubbles it is trying to follow. Using coherent synthetic summation, ultrafast plane wave imaging could attain similar image quality, while reducing the peak acoustic pressure and bubble disruption. Method: In these experiments, microbubbles were flowed in a wall-less vessel phantom. Images were obtained on a programmable clinical scanner with a set of line-per-line focused pulses for conventional contrast imaging and with compounded plane wave transmission adapted for nonlinear imaging. Imaging was performed between 14 and 650 kPa peak negative pressure at 7.5 MHz. The disruption of the microbubbles was evaluated by comparing the microbubble intensity before and after acquisition of a set of 100 images at various pressures. Results: The acoustic intensity required to disrupt 50\% of the microbubbles was 24 times higher with plane-wave imaging compared with conventional focused pulses. Although both imaging approaches yield similar resolution, at the same disruption level, plane-wave imaging showed better contrast. In particular, at similar disruption ratio (50\% after 100 images), contrast-pulse sequencing (CPS) performed with plane waves displayed an improvement of 11 dB compared with conventional nonlinear imaging. Conclusion: In each resolution cell of the image, plane-wave imaging spread the spatial peak acoustic intensity over more pulses, reducing the peak pressure and, hence, preserving the microbubbles. This method could contribute to molecular imaging by allowing the continuous monitoring of the accumulation of microbubbles with improved contrast.},

  abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Ultrasound (SAU) Imaging is an advanced form of imaging technology used to form high-resolution images in biomedical ultrasound systems. Ultrasound Imaging has become an important and popular medical imaging method, as it is safer and more economical than computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Compared with the conventional ultrasound image formation where one transducer or linear array is used, SAU imaging has achieved higher lateral resolution and deeper penetration, which will enable a more accurate diagnosis in medical applications, with no obvious loss in frame rate and without a large burden in computational complexities.SAU is based on synthetic beamforming and focusing which are processes whereby the pulse-echo responses from individual pairs of elements are synthesized to reconstruct the formation and focusing, relying on the rule of linear super-position. The working principle of a basic SAU imaging system is one that transmits an ultrasound wave by each small group of all array elements in turn, receive a signal using all possible receive array units, and then reconstruct the image by weighted summation of all demodulated received recordings.The important advantage of SAU is its ability to achieve dynamic focusing at both transmission and reception without repeating the transmission process with all array elements for each focal zone, thus it saves large computational requirements for delay-and-sum beamforming and leaves space for increasing the frame rate. Also the single transmission and receiving requirement for each firing significantly reduces the hardware complexity for system implementations.},

  abstract = {Currently, the nonadaptive delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer is extensively used for ultrasound imaging, despite the fact that it has lower resolution and worse interference suppression capability than the adaptive standard Capon beamformer (SCB) if the steering vector corresponding to the signal of interest (SOI) is accurately known. The main problem which restricts the use of SCB, however, is that SCB lacks robustness against steering vector errors that are inevitable in practice. Whenever this happens, the performance of SCB may become worse than that of DAS. Therefore, a robust adaptive beamformer is desirable to maintain the robustness of DAS and adaptivity of SCB. In this paper we consider a recent promising robust Capon beamformer (RCB) for ultrasound imaging. We propose two ways of implementing RCB, one based on time delay and the other based on time reversal. RCB extends SCB by allowing the array steering vector to be within an uncertainty set. Hence, it restores the appeal of SCB including its high resolution and superb interference suppression capabilities, and also retains the attractiveness of DAS including its robustness against steering vector errors. The time-delay-based RCB can tolerate the misalignment of data samples and the time-reversal-based RCB can withstand the uncertainty of the Green's function. Both time-delay-based RCB and time-reversal-based RCB can be efficiently computed at a comparable cost to SCB. The excellent performances of the proposed robust adaptive beamforming approaches are demonstrated via a number of simulated and experimental examples.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive ultrafast imaging of intrinsic waves such as electromechanical waves or remotely induced shear waves in elastography imaging techniques for human cardiac applications remains challenging. In this paper, we propose ultrafast imaging of the heart with adapted sector size by coherently compounding diverging waves emitted from a standard transthoracic cardiac phased-array probe. As in ultrafast imaging with plane wave coherent compounding, diverging waves can be summed coherently to obtain high-quality images of the entire heart at high frame rate in a full field of view. To image the propagation of shear waves with a large SNR, the field of view can be adapted by changing the angular aperture of the transmitted wave. Backscattered echoes from successive circular wave acquisitions are coherently summed at every location in the image to improve the image quality while maintaining very high frame rates. The transmitted diverging waves, angular apertures, and subaperture sizes were tested in simulation, and ultrafast coherent compounding was implemented in a commercial scanner. The improvement of the imaging quality was quantified in phantoms and in one human heart, in vivo. Imaging shear wave propagation at 2500 frames/s using 5 diverging waves provided a large increase of the SNR of the tissue velocity estimates while maintaining a high frame rate. Finally, ultrafast imaging with 1 to 5 diverging waves was used to image the human heart at a frame rate of 4500 to 900 frames/s over an entire cardiac cycle. Spatial coherent compounding provided a strong improvement of the imaging quality, even with a small number of transmitted diverging waves and a high frame rate, which allows imaging of the propagation of electromechanical and shear waves with good image quality.},

  abstract = {Real-time spatial compound imaging (SonoCT) is an ultrasound technique that uses electronic beam steering of a transducer array to rapidly acquire several (three to nine) overlapping scans of an object from different view angles. These single-angle scans are averaged to form a multiangle compound image that is updated in real time with each subsequent scan. Compound imaging shows improved image quality compared with conventional ultrasound, primarily because of reduction of speckle, clutter, and other acoustic artifacts. Early clinical experience suggests that real-time spatial compound imaging can provide improved contrast resolution and tissue differentiation that is beneficial for imaging the breast, peripheral blood vessels, and musculoskeletal injuries. Future development of real-time spatial compound imaging will help address the bulk of general imaging applications by extending this technology to curved array transducers, tissue harmonics, panoramic imaging, and three-dimensional sonography.},

  doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2015.0127},
  abstract = {Ultrafast imaging based on coherent plane-wave compounding is one of the most important recent developments in medical ultrasound. It significantly improves image quality and allows for much faster image acquisition. This method, however, incurs severe computational loads that create a major bottleneck in its implementation using existing commercial systems. To overcome this limitation we translate the beamforming, which is the basic processing step, to the frequency domain. As a result the computations can be carried out much more efficiently and using less data samples. To this end, we extend the frequency domain beamforming (FDBF) framework developed recently for the focused imaging mode to plane-wave imaging. We show that the core of FDBF, the relationship between the beam and the detected signals in the frequency domain, holds and can be implemented efficiently by introducing an appropriate approximation. We also show that dynamic aperture and apodization, crucial for image quality improvement, can be applied directly in frequency as a part of FDBF. The translation of beamforming into the frequency domain allows for data rate reduction by eliminating oversampling, required by digital implementation of beamforming in time. As a result the signals are sampled and processed at their effective Nyquist rate, leading to a 4-fold reduction in the number of samples.},

  doi = {10.1109/ACSSC.2006.355018},
  abstract = {Synthetic aperture (SA) ultrasound imaging has not been introduced in commercial scanners mainly due to the computational cost associated with the hardware implementation of this imaging modality. SA imaging redefines the term beamformed line. Since the acquired information comes from all points in the region of interest it is possible to beamform the signals along a desired path, thus, improving the estimation of blood flow. The transmission of coded excitations makes it possible to achieve higher contrast and larger penetration depth compared to "conventional" scanners. This paper presents the development and implementation of the signal processing stages employed in SA imaging: compression of received data acquired using codes, and beamforming. The goal was to implement the system using commercially available field programmable gate arrays. The compression filter operates on frequency modulated pulses with duration of up to 50 mus sampled at 70 MHz. The beamformer can process data from 256 channels at a pulse repetition frequency of 5000 Hz and produces 192 lines of 1024 complex samples in real time. The lines are described by their origin, direction, length and distance between two samples in 3D. This parametric description makes it possible to quickly change the image geometry during scanning, thus enabling adaptive imaging and precise flow estimation. The paper addresses problems such as large bandwidth and computational load and gives the solutions that have been adopted for the implementation.},

  doi = {10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591415},
  abstract = {Improving the frame rate is an important aspect in medical ultrasound imaging, particularly in 3D/4D cardiac applications. However, an accurate trade-off between the higher frame rate and image contrast and resolution should be performed. Plane-Wave Imaging (PWI) can potentially achieve frame rates in the order of 10 kHz, as it uses a single unfocused plane wave (and thus a single transmit event) to acquire the image of the entire region of interest. The lack of transmit focusing however causes a significant drop of image quality, which can be restored by coherently compounding several tilted plane-wave frames, at the expense of the frame rate. PWI together with the use of a beamforming algorithm able to achieve a higher image contrast resolution, such as the Delay Multiply And Sum (DMAS), could thus allow to improve image quality achieving a high frame rate at the same time. This paper presents the first simulation results obtained by employing DMAS beamforming and PWI with different transmission angles and coherent compounding. The simulated Point Spread Function (PSF) and cyst-phantom images show that DMAS makes it possible to achieve a high image quality with a reduced number of compounded frames compared to standard Delay And Sum (DAS), and hence it can be used to improve the contrast and resolution of plane-wave images still achieving a very high frame rate.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel processing framework is introduced for Fourier-domain beamforming of plane-wave ultrasound data, which incorporates coherent compounding and angular weighting in the Fourier domain. Angular weighting implies spectral weighting by a 2-D steering-angle-dependent filtering template. The design of this filter is also optimized as part of this paper. Two widely used Fourier-domain plane-wave ultrasound beamforming methods, i.e., Lu's f-k and Stolt's f-k methods, were integrated in the framework. To enable coherent compounding in Fourier domain for the Stolt's f-k method, the original Stolt's f-k method was modified to achieve alignment of the spectra for different steering angles in k-space. The performance of the framework was compared for both methods with and without angular weighting using experimentally obtained data sets (phantom and in vivo), and data sets (phantom) provided by the IEEE IUS 2016 plane-wave beamforming challenge. The addition of angular weighting enhanced the image contrast while preserving image resolution. This resulted in images of equal quality as those obtained by conventionally used delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming with apodization and coherent compounding. Given the lower computational load of the proposed framework compared to DAS, to our knowledge it can, therefore, be concluded that it outperforms commonly used beamforming methods such as Stolt's f-k, Lu's f-k, and DAS.},

Several dynamic methods are discussed: vibro-acoustography, Acoustic Radiation Force Impulsion (ARFI), transient elastography, shear wave imaging, etc. This paper aims to help the reader at understanding the differences between the different methods of this promising imaging modality that may become a significant tool in medical imaging.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle is a very dynamic tissue, thus accurate quantification of skeletal muscle stiffness throughout its functional range is crucial to improve the physical functioning and independence following pathology. Shear wave elastography (SWE) is an ultrasound-based technique that characterizes tissue mechanical properties based on the propagation of remotely induced shear waves. The objective of this study is to validate SWE throughout the functional range of motion of skeletal muscle for three ultrasound transducer orientations. We hypothesized that combining traditional materials testing (MTS) techniques with SWE measurements will show increased stiffness measures with increasing tensile load, and will correlate well with each other for trials in which the transducer is parallel to underlying muscle fibers. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored the deformation throughout tensile loading of four porcine brachialis whole-muscle tissue specimens, while simultaneously making SWE measurements of the same specimen. We used regression to examine the correlation between Young${'}$s modulus from MTS and shear modulus from SWE for each of the transducer orientations. We applied a generalized linear model to account for repeated testing. Model parameters were estimated via generalized estimating equations. The regression coefficient was 0.1944, with a 95\% confidence interval of (0.1463\textendash{}0.2425) for parallel transducer trials. Shear waves did not propagate well for both the 45$^\circ$ and perpendicular transducer orientations. Both parallel SWE and MTS showed increased stiffness with increasing tensile load. This study provides the necessary first step for additional studies that can evaluate the distribution of stiffness throughout muscle.},

  abstract = {Estimation of individual muscle forces during human movement can provide insight into neural control and tissue loading and can thus contribute to improved diagnosis and management of both neurological and orthopaedic conditions. Direct measurement of muscle forces is generally not feasible in a clinical setting, and non-invasive methods based on musculoskeletal modeling should therefore be considered. The current state of the art in clinical movement analysis is that resultant joint torques can be reliably estimated from motion data and external forces (inverse dynamic analysis). Static optimization methods to transform joint torques into estimates of individual muscle forces using musculoskeletal models, have been known for several decades. To date however, none of these methods have been successfully translated into clinical practice. The main obstacles are the lack of studies reporting successful validation of muscle force estimates, and the lack of user-friendly and efficient computer software. Recent advances in forward dynamics methods have opened up new opportunities. Forward dynamic optimization can be performed such that solutions are less dependent on measured kinematics and ground reaction forces, and are consistent with additional knowledge, such as the force\textendash{}length\textendash{}velocity\textendash{}activation relationships of the muscles, and with observed electromyography signals during movement. We conclude that clinical applications of current research should be encouraged, supported by further development of computational tools and research into new algorithms for muscle force estimation and their validation.},

  abstract = {Viscoelastic mechanical properties are frequently altered after tendon injuries and during recovery. Therefore, non-invasive measurements of shear viscoelastic properties may help evaluate tendon recovery and compare the effectiveness of different therapies. The objectives of this study were to describe an elastography method for measuring localized viscoelastic properties of tendons and to discuss the initial results in healthy and injured human Achilles and semitendinosus tendons. The technique used an external actuator to generate the shear waves in the tendon at different frequencies and plane wave imaging to measure shear wave displacements. For each of the excitation frequencies, maps of direction-specific wave speeds were calculated using local frequency estimation. Maps of viscoelastic properties were obtained using a pixel-wise curve fit of wave speed and frequency. The method was validated by comparing measurements of wave speed in agarose gels with those obtained using magnetic resonance elastography. Measurements in human healthy Achilles tendons revealed a pronounced increase in wave speed as a function of frequency, which highlights the importance of tendon viscoelasticity. Additionally, the viscoelastic properties of the Achilles tendon were larger than those reported for other tissues. Measurements in a tendinopathic Achilles tendon indicated that it is feasible to quantify local viscoelastic properties. Similarly, measurement in the semitendinosus tendon revealed substantial differences in viscoelastic properties between the healthy and contralateral tendons. Consequently, this technique has the potential to evaluate localized changes in tendon viscoelastic properties caused by injury and during recovery in a clinical setting.},

  abstract = {Purpose
The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of depth and underlying bone on strain ratios and shear wave speeds for three different muscles in healthy volunteers. For strain ratios the influence from different reference region-of-interest positions was also evaluated.
Material and methods
Ten healthy volunteers (five males and five females) had their biceps brachii, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps muscle examined with strain- and shear wave elastography at three different depths and in regions located above bone and beside bone. Strain ratios were averaged from cine-loops of 10s length, and shear wave speeds were measured 10 times at each target point. The distance from the skin surface to the centre of each region-of-interest was measured. Measurements were evaluated with descriptive statistics and linear regression.
Results
Linear regression showed a significant influence on strain ratio measurements from the reference region-of-interest position, i.e. being above the same structures as the target region-of-interest or not (means: 1.65 and 0.78; (P$<$0.001)). For shear wave speeds, there was a significant influence from depth and location above or beside bone (P=0.011 and P=0.031).
Conclusion
Strain ratio values depend significantly on reference and target region-of-interest being above the same tissue, for instance bone. Strain ratios were not influenced by depth in this study. Shear wave speeds decreased with increasing scanning depth and if there was bone below the region-of-interest.},

  abstract = {ObjectivesEvaluate the effects of aging on healthy Achilles tendon and aponeurosis shear wave speed (SWS), a quantitative metric which reflects tissue elasticity.MethodsShear wave elastography was used to measure spatial variations in Achilles tendon SWS in healthy young (n = 15, 25 $\pm$ 4 years), middle-aged (n = 10, 49 $\pm$ 4 years) and older (n = 10, 68 $\pm$ 5 years) adults. SWS was separately measured in the free Achilles tendon, soleus aponeurosis and gastrocnemius aponeurosis in resting (R), stretched (dorsiflexed 15$^\circ$ from R) and slack (plantarflexed 15$^\circ$ from R) postures.ResultsSWS significantly increased with stretch and varied with age in all tendon regions. Slack free tendon SWS was significantly higher in older adults than young adults (p = 0.025). However, stretched soleus aponeurosis SWS was significantly lower in older adults than young adults (p = 0.01). Stretched gastrocnemius aponeurosis SWS was significantly lower in both middle-aged (p = 0.003) and older (p = 0.001) adults, relative to younger adults.ConclusionThese results suggest that aging alters spatial variations in Achilles tendon elasticity, which could alter deformations within the triceps surae muscle\textendash{}tendon units, thus affecting injury potential. The observed location- and posture-dependent variations highlight the importance of controlling ankle posture and imaging location when using shear wave approaches clinically to evaluate tendon disorders. Key Points \textbullet{} Shear wave elastography shows promise as a clinical quantitative ultrasound-based technique.\textbullet{} Aging induces location-dependent changes in Achilles tendon shear wave speed.\textbullet{} Spatial and postural dependence necessitates careful integration of this approach clinically.},

The lateral gastrocnemius (Achilles) tendons of 41 New Zealand white rabbits were surgically severed and repaired with growth factor coated sutures. SWE imaging was used to measure shear wave speed (SWS) in both the medial and lateral tendons pre-surgery, and at 2 and 4 wk post-surgery. Rabbits were euthanized at 4 wk, and both medial and lateral tendons underwent mechanical testing to failure. SWS significantly (p $<$ 0.001) decreased an average of 17\% between the intact and post-surgical state across all tendons. SWS was significantly (p $<$ 0.001) correlated with both the tendon elastic modulus (r~= 0.52) and ultimate stress (r~= 0.58).

  abstract = {Although elastography has been increasingly used for evaluating muscle shear modulus associated with age, sex, musculoskeletal, and neurological conditions, its physiological meaning is largely unknown. This knowledge gap may hinder data interpretation, limiting the potential of using elastography to gain insights into muscle biomechanics in health and disease. We derived a mathematical model from a widely-accepted Hill-type passive force\textendash{}length relationship to gain insight about the physiological meaning of resting shear modulus of skeletal muscles under passive stretching, and validated the model by comparing against the ex-vivo animal data reported in our recent work (Koo et al. 2013). The model suggested that resting shear modulus of a slack muscle is a function of specific tension and parameters that govern the normalized passive muscle force\textendash{}length relationship as well as the degree of muscle anisotropy. The model also suggested that although the slope of the linear shear modulus\textendash{}passive force relationship is primarily related to muscle anatomical cross-sectional area (i.e. the smaller the muscle cross-sectional area, the more the increase in shear modulus to result in the same passive muscle force), it is also governed by the normalized passive muscle force\textendash{}length relationship and the degree of muscle anisotropy. Taken together, although muscle shear modulus under passive stretching has a strong linear relationship with passive muscle force, its actual value appears to be affected by muscle's mechanical, material, and architectural properties. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting the muscle shear modulus values.},

Unfortunately, direct measurement of passive muscle force is still beyond the current state-of-the-art. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of using Supersonic shear wave elastography (SSWE) to indirectly measure passive muscle force. Sixteen gastronomies pars externus and 16 tibialis anterior muscles were dissected from 10 fresh roaster chickens. For each muscle specimen, the proximal bone\textendash{}tendon junction was kept intact with its tibia or femur clamped in a fixture. Calibration weights (0\textendash{}400g in 25g per increment) were applied to the distal tendon via a pulley system and muscle elasticity was measured simultaneously using SSWE. The measurements were repeated for 3 cycles. The elasticity-load relationship of each tested muscle for each loading cycle was analyzed by fitting a least-squares regression line to the data. Test-retest reliability was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results demonstrated that the relationships between SSWE elasticity and passive muscle force were highly linear for all the tested muscles with coefficients of determination ranging between 0.971 and 0.999. ICCs were 0.996 and 0.985, respectively, for the slope and y-intercept parameters of the regression lines, indicating excellent reliability. These findings indicate that SSWE, when carefully applied, can be a highly reliable technique for muscle elasticity measurements. The linear relationship between SSWE elasticity and passive muscle force identified in the present study demonstrated that SSWE may be used as an indirect measure of passive muscle force.},

  abstract = {During human locomotion lower extremity muscle-tendon units undergo cyclic length changes that were previously assumed to be representative of muscle fascicle length changes. Measurements in cats and humans have since revealed that muscle fascicle length changes can be uncoupled from those of the muscle-tendon unit. Ultrasonography is frequently used to estimate fascicle length changes during human locomotion. Fascicle length analysis requires time consuming manual methods that are prone to human error and experimenter bias. To bypass these limitations, we have developed an automatic fascicle tracking method based on the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm with an affine optic flow extension. The aims of this study were to compare gastrocnemius fascicle length changes during locomotion using the automated and manual approaches and to determine the repeatability of the automated approach. Ultrasound was used to examine gastrocnemius fascicle lengths in eight participants walking at 4, 5, 6, and 7 km/h and jogging at 7 km/h on a treadmill. Ground reaction forces and three dimensional kinematics were recorded simultaneously. The level of agreement between methods and the repeatability of the automated method were quantified using the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Regardless of speed, the level of agreement between methods was high, with overall CMC values of 0.90 $\pm$ 0.09 (95\% CI: 0.86\textendash{}0.95). Repeatability of the algorithm was also high, with an overall CMC of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.08 (95\% CI: 0.79\textendash{}0.96). The automated fascicle tracking method presented here is a robust, reliable, and time-efficient alternative to the manual analysis of muscle fascicle length during gait.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound shear wave elastography is becoming a valuable tool for measuring mechanical properties of individual muscles. Since ultrasound shear wave elastography measures shear modulus along the principal axis of the probe (i.e., along the transverse axis of the imaging plane), the measured shear modulus most accurately represents the mechanical property of the muscle along the fascicle direction when the probe's principal axis is parallel to the fascicle direction in the plane of the ultrasound image. However, it is unclear how the measured shear modulus is affected by the probe angle relative to the fascicle direction in the same plane. The purpose of the present study was therefore to examine whether the angle between the principal axis of the probe and the fascicle direction in the same plane affects the measured shear modulus. Shear modulus in seven specially-designed tissue-mimicking phantoms, and in eleven human in-vivo biceps brachii and medial gastrocnemius were determined by using ultrasound shear wave elastography. The probe was positioned parallel or 20$^\circ$ obliquely to the fascicle across the B-mode images. The reproducibility of shear modulus measurements was high for both parallel and oblique conditions. Although there was a significant effect of the probe angle relative to the fascicle on the shear modulus in human experiment, the magnitude was negligibly small. These findings indicate that the ultrasound shear wave elastography is a valid tool for evaluating the mechanical property of pennate muscles along the fascicle direction.},

  abstract = {In human standing, gravity causes forward toppling about the ankle joint which is prevented by activity in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. It has long been assumed that when people sway forwards the calf muscles are stretched and conversely that they shorten with backward sway. Consequently, for many years, two explanations for standing stabilization have flourished. First, tonic muscle activity itself may generate adequate intrinsic ankle stiffness. Second, if intrinsic ankle stiffness is inadequate, the resistance to stretch of the calf muscles may be augmented by stretch reflexes or by central control. These explanations require that the passive tissue (Achilles' tendon, foot) transmitting the calf muscle tension is stiff. However, our recent measurements have indicated that this passive tissue is not stiff during standing. Accordingly, we predicted a counterintuitive mode of control where the muscles and body must, on average, move in opposite directions (paradoxical movements). Here we use dynamic ultrasound imaging in vivo with novel automated tracking of muscle length to test our hypothesis. We show that soleus and gastrocnemius do indeed move paradoxically, shortening when the body sways forward and lengthening when the body returns. This confirms that intrinsic ankle stiffness is too low to stabilize human standing. Moreover, it shows that the increase in active tension is associated with muscle shortening. This pattern cannot be produced by muscle stretch reflexes and can only arise from the anticipatory neural control of muscle length that is necessary for balance.},

  abstract = {1. During maintained ankle extension with background torques ranging from 0 to 70 N.m, the ankle extensors were stretched by a 5 degree rotation of the ankle joint. Maximal stretch velocity was 170 degrees/s. Regression analysis of simultaneous measurements of total torque and needle and surface electromyograms (EMG) from the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles showed that the soleus muscle generates about two-thirds of the maximal torque (approximately 120 Nm) with the subjects in sitting position. In addition, it was found that there is considerable cross talk between the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles when EMGs are recorded by surface electrodes. 2. The soleus EMG response to stretch began with a "phasic" response (latency 41 +/- 4 ms, mean +/- SD), consisting of two peaks, labeled M1 and M2. The phasic response ended 120-140 ms after stretch onset and was followed by a period of reduced EMG activity, ending at 170-210 ms. After this "silent period," a smaller "tonic" response was seen. The phasic responses of the soleus muscle were much larger than the corresponding responses in the anterior tibial muscle. In contrast, the tonic responses were comparable in the soleus and anterior tibial muscles. 3. The amplitudes of the phasic M1 and M2 responses were independent of the level of the background contraction. This disagrees with the "automatic gain principle," according to which the amplitudes of M1 and M2 should increase proportionally with the background EMG. In contrast to the phasic responses, the amplitude of the tonic EMG response, measured 200-400 ms after stretch onset, followed the automatic gain principle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We used electromyography (EMG) and high-speed ultrasonography concomitantly to monitor muscle activity and muscle fascicle behavior in 19 healthy volunteers as they walked across a platform. On random trials, the platform was dropped (8 cm, 0.9 g acceleration) or held at a small inclination (up to $\pm$3$^\circ$ in the parasagittal plane) with respect to level ground. Dropping the platform in the mid and late phases of stance produced a depression in the soleus muscle activity with an onset latency of about 50 ms. The reduction in ground reaction force also unloaded the plantar flexor muscles. The soleus muscle fascicles shortened with a minimum delay of 14 ms. Small variations in platform inclination produced significant changes in triceps surae muscle activity; EMG increased when stepping on an inclined surface and decreased when stepping on a declined surface. This sensory modulation of the locomotor output was concomitant with changes in triceps surae muscle fascicle and gastrocnemius tendon length. Assuming that afferent activity correlates to these mechanical changes, our results indicate that within-step sensory feedback from the plantar flexor muscles automatically adjusts muscle activity to compensate for small ground irregularities. The delayed onset of muscle fascicle movement after dropping the platform indicates that at least the initial part of the soleus depression is more likely mediated by a decrease in force feedback than length-sensitive feedback, indicating that force feedback contributes to the locomotor activity in human walking.},

  abstract = {1. The modulation of the short-latency stretch reflex during walking at different walking speeds was investigated and compared with the stretch reflex during standing in healthy human subjects. 2. Ankle joint stretches were applied by a system able to rotate the human ankle joint during treadmill walking in any phase of the step cycle. The system consisted of a mechanical joint attached to the subject's ankle joint and connected to a motor placed beside the treadmill by means of bowden wires. The weight of the total system attached to the leg of the subject was 900 g. 3. The short-latency soleus stretch reflex was modulated during a step. In the stance phase, the amplitude equaled that found during standing at matched soleus background electromyogram (EMG). In the transition from stance to swing, the amplitude was 0 in all subjects. In late swing, the stretch reflex amplitude increased to 45 +/- 27\% (mean +/- SD) of the maximal amplitude in the stance phase (stretch amplitude 8 degrees, stretch velocity 250 degrees/s). 4. The onset (42 +/- 3.2 ms) and peak latencies (59 +/- 2.5 ms) of the stretch reflex did not depend on the phase in the step cycle at which the reflex was elicited. 5. When the ankle joint is rotated, a change in torque can be measured. The torque measured over the first 35 ms after stretch onset (nonreflex torque) was at a maximum during late stance, when the leg supported a large part of the body's weight, and at a minimum during the swing phase. At heel contact the nonreflex torque was 50\% of its maximal value. 6. During the stance phase the maximal EMG stretch reflex had a phase lead of approximately 120 ms with respect to the maximal background EMG and a phase lead of approximately 250 ms with respect to the maximal nonreflex torque. 7. The constant latency of the stretch reflex during a step implied that the ankle extensor muscle spindles are always taut during walking. 8. The relatively high amplitude of the stretch reflex in late swing and at heel contact made it likely that the stretch reflex contributed to the activation of the ankle extensor muscles in early stance phase.},

In 1980, dystrophic muscle tissue was found to show typical US changes. Over the next three decades, muscle US has developed into a reliable screening tool for childhood neuromuscular disorders that can also be used to select an optimal biopsy site. In addition to its application in the field of neurology, muscle US is used in oncology for diagnosing soft tissue tumors and in sports medicine and physical therapy for imaging muscle and tendon injuries.},

  doi = {10.1152/physrev.00028.2005},
  abstract = {Locomotion results from intricate dynamic interactions between a central program and feedback mechanisms. The central program relies fundamentally on a genetically determined spinal circuitry (central pattern generator) capable of generating the basic locomotor pattern and on various descending pathways that can trigger, stop, and steer locomotion. The feedback originates from muscles and skin afferents as well as from special senses (vision, audition, vestibular) and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern to the requirements of the environment. The dynamic interactions are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust the timing and amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the opposite phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. Similarly, stimulation of descending pathways may affect the locomotor pattern in only certain phases of the step cycle. Section ii reviews dynamic sensorimotor interactions mainly through spinal pathways. Section iii describes how similar sensory inputs from the spinal or supraspinal levels can modify locomotion through descending pathways. The sensorimotor interactions occur obviously at several levels of the nervous system. Section iv summarizes presynaptic, interneuronal, and motoneuronal mechanisms that are common at these various levels. Together these mechanisms contribute to the continuous dynamic adjustment of sensorimotor interactions, ensuring that the central program and feedback mechanisms are congruous during locomotion.},

  abstract = {Control schemes for powered ankle\textendash{}foot prostheses would benefit greatly from a means to make them inherently adaptive to different walking speeds. Towards this goal, one may attempt to emulate the intact human ankle, as it is capable of seamless adaptation. Human locomotion is governed by the interplay among legged dynamics, morphology and neural control including spinal reflexes. It has been suggested that reflexes contribute to the changes in ankle joint dynamics that correspond to walking at different speeds. Here, we use a data-driven muscle\textendash{}tendon model that produces estimates of the activation, force, length and velocity of the major muscles spanning the ankle to derive local feedback loops that may be critical in the control of those muscles during walking. This purely reflexive approach ignores sources of non-reflexive neural drive and does not necessarily reflect the biological control scheme, yet can still closely reproduce the muscle dynamics estimated from biological data. The resulting neuromuscular model was applied to control a powered ankle\textendash{}foot prosthesis and tested by an amputee walking at three speeds. The controller produced speed-adaptive behaviour; net ankle work increased with walking speed, highlighting the benefits of applying neuromuscular principles in the control of adaptive prosthetic limbs.},

EMG and MMG activities were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle during slow concentric, isometric, and eccentric contraction at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\% of the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The combination of the EMG and MMG recordings during voluntary concentric\textendash{}isometric\textendash{}eccentric contraction showed significant different non-linear EMG/force and MMG/force relationships (P$<$0.001). The EMG root mean square (rms) values increased significantly from 0 to 50\% MVC during concentric and isometric contraction and up to 75\% MVC during eccentric contraction (P$<$0.05). The MMG rms values increased significantly from 0 to 50\% MVC during concentric contraction (P$<$0.05). The non-linear relationships depended mainly on the type and the level of contraction together with the angular velocity. Furthermore, the type of contraction, the contraction level, and the angular velocity influenced the electromechanical efficiency evaluated as the MMG to EMG ratio (P$<$0.05). These results highlight that EMG and MMG provide complementary information about the electrical and mechanical activity of the muscle. Different activation strategies seem to be used during graded isometric and anisometric contraction.},

Twenty-one volunteers [mean age (SD) 21.5 (1.3) years] performed maximal, voluntary concentric isokinetic leg extensions for the dominant and non-dominant limbs at 60 and 240$^\circ\cdot$s-1. Surface EMG ($\mu$Vrms) and MMG (mVrms) signals were recorded from the VL and RF muscles during the isokinetic tests. PT (Nm), the joint angle at PT, and MP (W) were calculated by a dynamometer. Following the initial isokinetic tests, the dominant leg extensors were stretched using four static stretching exercises. After the stretching, the isokinetic tests were repeated. PT decreased (P$\leq$0.05) from pre- to post-stretching for the stretched limb at 60 and 240$^\circ\cdot$s-1 and for the unstretched limb at 60$^\circ\cdot$s-1. EMG amplitude of the VL and RF also decreased (P$\leq$0.05) from pre- to post-stretching for the stretched and unstretched limbs. There were no stretching-induced changes (P$>$0.05) for the joint angle at PT, MP, or MMG amplitude. These findings indicated stretching-induced decreases in force production and muscle activation. The decreases in PT and EMG amplitude for the unstretched limb suggested that the stretching-induced decreases may be due to a central nervous system inhibitory mechanism.},

  abstract = {Sagittal plane biomechanical and EMG analyses from eight below knee (BK) amputee trials demonstrate considerably modified motor patterns from the residual muscles at the hip and knee. Five SACH fittings, two Uniaxial and one Gressinger prostheses were analysed. Moments of force and mechanical power were analysed on all eight trials and EMG profiles are reported for three of the amputees fitted with SACH prostheses. The findings can be summarized as follows: 1.1. All eight trials had similar internal moment of force patterns at the ankle. A dorsiflexor moment commenced at heel contact and continued for the first third of stance. The prostheses generated a plantarflexor moment for the balance of stance which increased in late stance to about 23 that seen in normals.2.2. The two Uniaxial prostheses showed a 20\% recovery of stored energy which was returned at push-off. The recovery by the Gressinger fitting was 30\%.3.3. For all but the Gressinger prosthesis the knee moment of force was negligible during early stance (when normals have an extensor moment), below normal in late stance and fairly normal during swing. The amputee wearing the Gressinger prosthesis had a normal but slightly reduced pattern of moments of force over the entire stride.4.4. All eight trials had hyperactive hip extensors during early and mid-stance which resulted in above-normal energy generation by these concentrically contracting muscles. This compensation makes up for the loss of the major energy generation by the plantarflexors at push-off.5.5. The moment of force and power patterns at the hip for all eight trials during late stance and swing were fairly normal.6.6. Because of hyperactivity of the hamstrings during early stance there is an excessive knee flexor moment which is cancelled out by co-contracting knee extensors at that time.},

  abstract = {A hydraulically actuated platform with 4-degrees of freedom (4-DOF) was designed to be able to apply velocity- or acceleration-controlled floor surface perturbations to freely walking human subjects. The apparatus was required to provide velocity-controlled translational perturbations over the floor surface, rotational perturbations about the ankle joint, and acceleration-controlled vertical translational perturbations. The apparatus was physically constructed, and tested by both measurements of dynamics and repeatability. Crossover of movement from one DOF to another was shown to be less than 1 mm or 0.5deg for all desired perturbations. Repeated perturbations were nearly identical with a standard deviation of less than 0.2 mm over translational axes. The application of the platform to human gait research was demonstrated with a protocol of midstance phase perturbations (n = 8). For this, the platform controller was programmed to randomly select one out of three conditions: 1) no movement (control); 2) upward perturbation of 0.8 g, 50 mm, 300 ms after heel contact; 3) downward perturbation of 0.8 g, 50 mm, 300 ms after heel contact. In total, 90 trials (3 conditions times 30 repetitions) were recorded for each subject. By singling out the SOL EMG and normalizing and averaging over the subject population, it was shown that the upward and downward perturbations elicited at least two distinctive stereotypical reflex responses in the ankle extensors, opposite in sign. All subjects reported comfort with the apparatus and nobody fell.},

The spindle model incorporates three nonlinear intrafusal fiber models (bag1, bag2, and chain) that contribute variously to action potential generation of primary and secondary afferents. A single set of model parameters was optimized on a number of data sets collected from feline soleus muscle, accounting accurately for afferent activity during a variety of ramp, triangular, and sinusoidal stretches. We also incorporated the different temporal properties of fusimotor activation as observed in the twitchlike chain fibers versus the toniclike bag fibers. The model captures the spindle's behavior both in the absence of fusimotor stimulation and during activation of static or dynamic fusimotor efferents. In the case of simultaneous static and dynamic fusimotor efferent stimulation, we demonstrated the importance of including the experimentally observed effect of partial occlusion. The model was validated against data that originated from the cat's medial gastrocnemius muscle and were different from the data used for the parameter determination purposes. The validation record included recently published experiments in which fusimotor efferent and spindle afferent activities were recorded simultaneously during decerebrate locomotion in the cat. This model will be useful in understanding the role of the muscle spindle and its fusimotor control during both natural and pathological motor behavior.},

  abstract = {The replacement of proprioceptive function, whether for conscious sensation or feedback control, is likely to be an important aspect of neural prosthetic restoration of limb movements. Thus far, however, it has been hampered by the absence of unobtrusive sensors. We propose a method whereby fully implanted, telemetrically operated BIONstrade monitor muscle movement, and thereby detect changes in joint angle(s) and/or limb posture without requiring the use of secondary components attached to limb segments or external reference frames. The sensor system is designed to detect variations in the electrical coupling between devices implanted in neighboring muscles that result from changes in their relative position as the muscles contract and stretch with joint motion. The goal of this study was to develop and empirically validate mathematical models of the sensing scheme and to use computer simulations to provide an early proof of concept and inform design of the overall sensor system. Results from experiments using paired dipoles in a saline bath and finite element simulations have given insight into the current distribution and potential gradients exhibited within bounded anisotropic environments similar to a human limb segment and demonstrated an anticipated signal to noise ratio of at least 8:1 for submillimeter resolution of relative implant movement over a range of implant displacements up to 15 cm},

  abstract = {Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) is a syndrome that frequently follows an injury and is characterized by sensory, autonomic and motor features of the affected extremities. One of the more common motor features of RSD is tonic dystonia, which is caused by impairment of inhibitory interneuronal spinal circuits. In this study the circuits that modulate the gain of proprioceptive reflexes of the shoulder musculature are quantitatively assessed in 19 RSD patients, 9 of whom presented with dystonia. The proprioceptive reflexes are quantified by applying two types of force disturbances: (1) disturbances with a fixed low frequency and a variable bandwidth and (2) disturbances with a small bandwidth around a prescribed centre frequency. Compared to controls, patients have lower reflex gains for velocity feedback in response to the disturbances around a prescribed centre frequency. Additionally, patients with dystonia lack the ability to generate negative reflex gains for position feedback, for these same disturbances. Proprioceptive reflexes to the disturbances with a fixed low frequency and variable bandwidth present no difference between patients and controls. Although dystonia in the RSD patients was limited to the distal musculature, the results suggest involvement of interneuronal circuits that mediate postsynaptic inhibition of the motoneurons of the proximal musculature.},

The feedforward control component forms an approximate representation of the inverse dynamics of the arm and its interaction with the environment. The feedback control component compensates for errors in the representation of the inverse dynamics and for unexpected forces acting on the arm. Moreover, the control system provides a solution for the redundancy of the muscles. The system performance is adapted in a learning procedure according to a speci\textregistered{}ed goal function. It is shown in the paper that good control of the nonlinear musculoskeletal model and neural control signals which are similar to electromyographic (EMG) data, are attained.

This was achieved by superimposing a small stochastic displacement upon many such changing contractions and then identifying the time-varying relationship between the perturbation and the evoked electromyograms (EMGs). An ``ensemble'' time-varying system identification technique was used to estimate these input-output dynamics as a set of impulse response functions, one for each time before, during, and after the change in contraction level, with a temporal resolution equal to the data acquisition rate. Three main findings resulted. First, stretch reflex gain (relating joint velocity to EMG) was significantly modulated during changes in voluntary contraction level, increasing as the subject contracted the muscles and decreasing as the subject relaxed. Second, stretch reflex dynamics did not change with contraction level, even when its gain varied substantially. Third, the time course of the gain changes closely followed the level of the EMG, even though the subjects used rather different activation and deactivation patterns. These results suggest that, for the behavior studied (i.e., rapid changes in isometric contraction level), stretch reflex gain and motoneuron pool activation level were controlled by a common descending command rather than being independently specified.},

Stretch reflex dynamics were estimated by superimposing a small stochastic displacement on many such stretches and using an ``ensemble-based'' time-varying identification procedure to compute impulse response functions relating the perturbation to the evoked electromyogram (EMG) at each point throughout the task. We found that stretch reflex magnitude (relating joint velocity to EMG) varied directly with baseline EMG activity during steady-state conditions before and after the large imposed stretch. Following the large stretch and the reflex activity it evoked, both background EMG and stretch reflex magnitude declined for up to 100 ms; changes in the stretch reflex were substantially greater in magnitude and followed a different time course from the corresponding changes in background EMG, however, indicating that stretch reflex properties were modulated independently of motoneuron pool activation level. Based on timing and the invariance of stretch reflex dynamics across time, it is argued that this behavior is largely mediated via peripheral neural mechanisms. This peripheral modulation of the stretch reflex presumably supplements various descending influences to adjust reflex properties.},

  abstract = {. A parallel-cascade system identification method was used to identify intrinsic and reflex contributions to dynamic ankle stiffness over a wide range of tonic voluntary contraction levels and ankle positions in healthy human subjects. Intrinsic stiffness dynamics were described well by a linear pathway having elastic, viscous, and inertial properties. A velocity-sensitive pathway comprising a delay, a static non-linearity, resembling a half-wave rectifier, followed by a low-pass filter, described reflex stiffness dynamics. The absolute magnitude of intrinsic and reflex stiffness parameters varied from subject to subject but the relative changes with contraction level and position were consistent. Intrinsic stiffness increased monotonically with contraction level while reflex stiffness was maximal at low contraction levels and then decreased. Intrinsic and reflex stiffness both increased as the ankle was dorsiflexed. As a result, reflex mechanics made their largest relative contributions near the neutral position at low levels of activity. The size of the maximum reflex contribution varied widely among subjects, in some it was so small (ca 1\%) that it would be unlikely to have any functional importance; however, in other subjects, reflex contributions were large enough (as high as 55\% in one case) to play a significant role in the control of posture and movement. This variability may have arisen because stretch reflexes were not useful for the torque-matching task in these experiments. It will be of interest to examine other tasks where stretch reflexes would have a direct impact on performance.},

  abstract = {A parallel-cascade system identification method was used to identify the reflex contribution to dynamic ankle stiffness in both normal and spastic spinal cord injured (SCI) subjects. Reflex dynamics were estimated by the impulse response function between half-wave rectified velocity and reflex torque. Parametric models were fitted to these IRFs using non-linear, least-squares methods. A simple, second-order low-pass model described reflex dynamic stiffness well for normal subjects at low contraction levels. However, this model was inadequate for normal subjects, at high contraction levels, and for SCI subjects at all contraction levels. Good fits were obtained using a third-order model consisting of a second-order low-pass in series with a first order pole. We hypothesized that the third order model might arise from a "clonus-like" reflex activation that comprised several distinct bursts of activity. Simulation studies showed that this pattern of reflex activation in series with muscle dynamics gave an overall response which was described very well by a third order model. Sensitivity studies demonstrated the systematic dependence of the parameters of the third-order model on the interval between bursts of activation and their decay.},

  abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this paper is to present a structural decomposition subspace (SDSS) method for decomposition of the joint torque to intrinsic, reflexive, and voluntary torques and identification of joint dynamic stiffness. Methods: First, it formulates a novel state-space representation for the joint dynamic stiffness modeled by a parallel-cascade structure with a concise parameter set that provides a direct link between the state-space representation matrices and the parallel-cascade parameters. Second, it presents a subspace method for the identification of the new state-space model that involves two steps: 1) the decomposition of the intrinsic and reflex pathways and 2) the identification of an impulse response model of the intrinsic pathway and a Hammerstein model of the reflex pathway. Results: Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that SDSS has significant performance advantages over some other methods. Thus, SDSS was more robust under high noise conditions, converging where others failed; it was more accurate, giving estimates with lower bias and random errors. The method also worked well in practice and yielded high-quality estimates of intrinsic and reflex stiffnesses when applied to experimental data at three muscle activation levels. Conclusion: The simulation and experimental results demonstrate that SDSS accurately decomposes the intrinsic and reflex torques and provides accurate estimates of physiologically meaningful parameters. Significance: SDSS will be a valuable tool for studying joint stiffness under functionally important conditions. It has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, assessment, objective quantification, and monitoring of neuromuscular diseases that change the muscle tone.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles acting about a joint influences joint stiffness and stability. Although several studies have shown that reflexes in the muscle lengthened by a joint perturbation are modulated during co-contraction, little attention has been given to reflex regulation in the antagonist (shortened) muscle. The goal of the present study was to determine whether co-contraction gives rise to altered reflex regulation across the joint by examining reflexes in the muscle shortened by a joint perturbation. Reflexes were recorded from electromyographic activity in elbow flexors and extensors while positional perturbations to the elbow joint were applied. Perturbations were delivered during isolated activation of the flexor or extensor muscles as well as during flexor and extensor co-contraction. Across the group, the shortening reflex in the elbow extensor switched from suppression during isolated extensor muscle activation to facilitation during co-contraction. The shortening reflex in the elbow flexor remained suppressive during co-contraction but was significantly smaller compared to the response obtained during isolated elbow flexor activation. This response in the shortened muscle was graded by the level of activation in the lengthened muscle. The lengthening reflex did not change during co-contraction. These results support the idea that reflexes are regulated across multiple muscles around a joint. We speculate that the facilitatory response in the shortened muscle arises through a fast-conducting oligosynaptic pathway involving Ib interneurons.},

Our approach is to: 1) derive a data-driven, mathematical model for dynamic stiffness for short data segments; 2) bin the non-stationary data into a number of short, stationary data segments; and 3) estimate the model parameters from subsets of segments with the same properties. This method extends our previous state-spacework by recognizing that initial conditions have important effects for short data segments; consequently, initial conditions are incorporated into the stiffness model and estimated for each segment. A simulation study that faithfully replicated experimental conditions delineated the range of experimental conditions for which the method can successfully identify stiffness. An experimental study on the ankle of a healthy subject during a torque matching tasks demonstrated the successful estimation of dynamic stiffness in a slow, time-varying experiment. Together, the simulation and experimental studies demonstrate that the SS-SDSS method is a valuable tool to measure stiffness in functionally important tasks.},

Skeletal muscle resists externally imposed stretches via both intrinsic stiffness properties of the muscle and reflexively mediated changes in muscle activation. To separately estimate these intrinsic and reflex components, system identification approaches must make several assumptions. We examined the impact of making specific structural assumptions about the intrinsic and reflex systems on the system identification accuracy. In particular, we compared an approach that made specific parametric assumptions about the reflex and intrinsic subsystems to another that assumed more general nonparametric subsystems. A simulation-based approach was used so that the ``true'' characters of the intrinsic and reflex systems were known; the identification methods were judged on their abilities to retrieve these known system properties. Identification algorithms were tested on three experimentally based models describing the stretch reflex system. Results indicated that the assumed form of the intrinsic and reflex systems had a significant impact on the stiffness separation accuracy. In general, the algorithm incorporating nonparametric subsystems was more robust than the fully parametric algorithm because it had a more general structure and because it provided a better indication of the appropriateness of the assumed structure.

  abstract = {It has been postulated that the central nervous system (CNS) can tune the mechanical behavior of a joint by altering reflex stiffness in a task-dependant manner. However, most of the evidence supporting this hypothesis has come from the analysis of H-reflexes or electromyogram (EMG) responses. Changes in overall stiffness have been documented but, as yet, there is no direct evidence that the CNS can control reflex stiffness independently of the intrinsic stiffness. We have used a novel identification algorithm to estimate intrinsic and reflex stiffness and feed it back to subjects in real-time. Using this biofeedback, subjects could learn to control reflex stiffness independently of intrinsic stiffness. At low torque levels, subjects could vary their reflex stiffness gain by a factor of 4, while maintaining elastic stiffness and torque constant. EMG measurements confirmed that the contraction levels of the ankle muscles remained constant. Further experiments showed that subjects could change their reflexes rapidly on command. Thus, we conclude that the CNS can control reflex stiffness independently and so has great flexibility in adjusting the mechanical properties of a joint to meet functional requirements.},

Significant improvements were found in the passive ROM, maximum voluntary contraction, ankle stiffness, and comfortable walking speed. The visual analog scales indicated very positive subjective evaluation in terms of the comfort of stretching and the effect on their involved ankle.
Conclusions
Repeated feedback-controlled or intelligent stretching had a positive influence on the joint properties of the ankle with spasticity and/or contracture after stroke. The stretching device may be an effective and safe alternative to manual passive motion treatment by a therapist and has potential to be used to repeatedly and regularly stretch the ankle of subjects with spasticity and/or contracture without daily involvement of clinicians or physical therapists.},

  abstract = {The naturally coexisting intrinsic mechanical and reflex properties of the human elbow joint were identified simultaneously using nonlinear, time-delay, continuous-time, and dynamic models. Angular random perturbations of small amplitude and low bandwidth were applied to the joint using a computer-controlled servomotor, while the subject maintained various levels of mean background muscle torque. Joint neuromuscular dynamics were identified from the measured elbow angle and torque. Stretch reflexes were modeled nonlinearly with both dynamic and static reflex gains. A continuous-time system identification method was developed to estimate parameters of the nonlinear models directly from sampled data while retaining realistic physical or physiological interpretations. Results from six subjects showed that dynamic stretch reflex gains, joint stiffness, and viscosity generally increased with mean background muscle torque; and that dynamic stretch reflex gain was higher during muscle stretch than that during muscle shortening. More importantly, the study provided realistic simultaneous estimates of the relative contributions of intrinsic mechanical and reflex actions to net joint torque. In particular, reflexively-mediated stiffness generated a significant portion of the total joint stiffness and the percentage varied systematically with background muscle torque.},

  abstract = {Muscle coordination may be difficult or impossible to predict accurately based on biomechanical considerations alone because of redundancy in the musculoskeletal system. Because many solutions exist for any given movement, the role of the nervous system in further constraining muscle coordination patterns for movement must be considered in both healthy and impaired motor control. On the basis of computational neuromechanical analyses of experimental data combined with modeling techniques, we have demonstrated several such neural constraints on the temporal and spatial patterns of muscle activity during both locomotion and postural responses to balance perturbations. We hypothesize that subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences in muscle activation can be parameterized and understood by a hierarchical and low-dimensional framework that reflects the neural control of task-level goals. In postural control, we demonstrate that temporal patterns of muscle activity may be governed by feedback control of task-level variables that represent the overall goal-directed motion of the body. These temporal patterns then recruit spatially-fixed patterns of muscle activity called muscle synergies that produce the desired task-level biomechanical functions that require multijoint coordination. Moreover, these principles apply more generally to movement, and in particular to locomotor tasks in both healthy and impaired individuals. Overall, understanding the goals and organization of the neural control of movement may provide useful reduced dimension parameter sets to address the degrees-of-freedom problem in musculoskeletal movement control. More importantly, however, neuromechanical analyses may lend insight and provide a framework for understanding subject-specific and trial-by-trial differences in movement across both healthy and motor-impaired populations.

  abstract = {The authors have examined dynamic stiffness at the human ankle using position perturbations which were designed to provide a wide-bandwidth input with low average velocity. A parallel-cascade, nonlinear system identification technique was used to separate overall stiffness into intrinsic and reflex components. Intrinsic stiffness was described by a linear, second-order system similar to that demonstrated previously. Reflex stiffness dynamics were more complex, comprising a delay, a unidirectional rate-sensitive element and then lowpass dynamics. Reflex mechanisms were found to be most important at frequencies of 5-10 Hz. The gain and dynamics of reflex stiffness varied strongly with the parameters of the perturbation, the gain decreasing as the mean velocity of the perturbation increased. Under some conditions, torques generated by reflex mechanisms were of the same magnitude as those from intrinsic mechanisms. It is concluded that reflex stiffness can be large enough to be important functionally, but that its effects will depend strongly upon the particular conditions.},

  abstract = {Dynamic joint stiffness defines the dynamic relationship between the position of a joint and the torque acting about it and can be separated into intrinsic and reflex components. Under stationary conditions, these can be identified using a nonlinear parallel-cascade algorithm that models intrinsic stiffness-a linear dynamic response to position-and reflex stiffness-a nonlinear dynamic response to velocity-as parallel pathways. Experiments using this method show that both intrinsic and reflex stiffness depend strongly on the operating point, defined by position and torque, likely because of some underlying nonlinear behavior not modeled by the parallel-cascade structure. Consequently, both intrinsic and reflex stiffness will appear to be time-varying whenever the operating point changes rapidly, as during movement. This paper describes and validates an extension of the parallel-cascade algorithm to time-varying conditions. It describes the ensemble method used to estimate time-varying intrinsic and reflex stiffness. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm can track rapid changes in joint stiffness accurately. Finally, the performance of the algorithm in the presence of noise is tested. We conclude that the new algorithm is a powerful new tool for the study of joint stiffness during functional tasks.},

  abstract = {The present review examines the experimental evidence supporting the existence of central mechanisms able to modulate the synaptic effectiveness of sensory fibers ending in the spinal cord of vertebrates. The first section covers work on the mode of operation and the synaptic mechanisms of presynaptic inhibition, in particular of the presynaptic control involving axo-axonic synapses made by GABAergic interneurons with the terminal arborizations of the afferent fibers. This includes reviewing of the ionic mechanisms involved in the generation of primary afferent depolarization (PAD) by GABAergic synapses, the ultrastructural basis underlying the generation of PAD, the relationship between PAD and presynaptic inhibition, the conduction of action potentials in the terminal arborizations of the afferent fibers, and the modeling of the presynaptic inhibitory synapse. The second section of the review deals with the functional organization of presynaptic inhibition. This includes the segmental and descending presynaptic control of the synaptic effectiveness of group-I and group-II muscle afferents, the evidence dealing with the local character of PAD as well as the differential inhibition of PAD in selected collaterals of individual muscle-spindle afferents by cutaneous and descending inputs. This section also examines observations on the presynaptic modulation of large cutaneous afferents, including the modulation of the synaptic effectiveness of thin myelinated and unmyelinated cutaneous fibers and of visceral afferents, as well as the presynaptic control of the synaptic actions of interneurons and descending tract neurons. The third section deals with the changes in PAD occurring during sleep and fictive locomotion in higher vertebrates and with the changes of presynaptic inhibition in humans during the execution of a variety of voluntary movements. In the final section, we examine the non-synaptic presynaptic modulation of transmitter release, including the possibility that the intraspinal endings of primary afferents also release colocalized peptides in a similar way as in the periphery. The outcome of the studies presently reviewed is that intraspinal terminals of sensory fibers are not hard-wired conductors of the information generated in their peripheral sensory receptors, but dynamic systems that convey information that can be selectively addressed by central mechanisms to specific neuronal targets. This central control of information flow in peripheral afferents appears to play an important role in the generation of integrated movements and processing of sensory information, including nociceptive information.},

These techniques are, however, only well developed for linear systems. Assuming linearity prescribes the neuromuscular system to be perturbed only around predefined operating points. In this study, we test the validity of a commonly used linear model by analyzing the effects of flexion-extension displacement amplitude (2$^\circ$, 4$^\circ$, and 8$^\circ$) on damping, stiffness, and reflex gain of the wrist joint, at different background torque levels (0, 1, and 2 N $\cdot$m). With displacement amplitude, intrinsic damping increased, while intrinsic stiffness and reflex gains decreased. These changes were dependent on the level of wrist torque. The dependency of the neuromuscular system properties on even small variations in angular displacement is evident and has to be accounted for when comparing different studies and clinical interpretations using linear identification techniques. Knowledge of the behavior of the neuromuscular system around operating points is an essential step toward the development of nonlinear models that allow for discrimination between patients and controls in a larger range of loading conditions.},

  abstract = {The complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a painful disorder that can occur in an extremity after any type of injury, or even spontaneously. Data on the incidence of CRPS are scarce and mostly hospital based. Therefore the size of the problem and its burden on health care and society are unknown. The objective of the present study was to estimate the incidence of CRPS in the general population. A retrospective cohort study was conducted during 1996\textendash{}2005 in the Integrated Primary Care Information (IPCI) project, a general practice research database with electronic patient record data from 600,000 patients throughout the Netherlands. Potential CRPS cases were identified by a sensitive search algorithm including synonyms and abbreviations for CRPS. Subsequently, cases were validated by electronic record review, supplemented with original specialist letters and information from an enquiry of general practitioners. The estimated overall incidence rate of CRPS was 26.2 per 100,000 person years (95\% CI: 23.0\textendash{}29.7). Females were affected at least three times more often than males (ratio: 3.4). The highest incidence occurred in females in the age category of 61\textendash{}70 years. The upper extremity was affected more frequently than the lower extremity and a fracture was the most common precipitating event (44\%). The observed incidence rate of CRPS is more as four times higher than the incidence rate observed in the only other population-based study, performed in Olmsted County, USA. Postmenopausal woman appeared to be at the highest risk for the development of CRPS.},

  abstract = {Background
About half of all chronic stroke patients experience loss of arm function coinciding with increased stiffness, reduced range of motion and a flexed wrist due to a change in neural and/or structural tissue properties. Quantitative assessment of these changes is of clinical importance, yet not trivial. The goal of this study was to quantify the neural and structural properties contributing to wrist joint stiffness and to compare these properties between healthy subjects and stroke patients.
Methods
Stroke patients (n=32) and healthy volunteers (n=14) were measured using ramp-and-hold rotations applied to the wrist joint by a haptic manipulator. Neural (reflexive torque) and structural (connective tissue stiffness and slack lengths and (contractile) optimal muscle lengths) parameters were estimated using an electromyography driven antagonistic wrist model. Kruskal\textendash{}Wallis analysis with multiple comparisons was used to compare results between healthy subjects, stroke patients with modified Ashworth score of zero and stroke patients with modified Ashworth score of one or more.
Findings
Stroke patients with modified Ashworth score of one or more differed from healthy controls (P$<$0.05) by increased tissue stiffness, increased reflexive torque, decreased optimal muscle length and decreased slack length of connective tissue of the flexor muscles.
Interpretation
Non-invasive quantitative analysis, including estimation of optimal muscle lengths, enables to identify neural and non-neural changes in chronic stroke patients. Monitoring these changes in time is important to understand the recovery process and to optimize treatment.},

The search was carried out across four major technical databases and the retrieved records were screened for their relevance. A total of 21 different active prostheses, including 8 above-knee, 9 below-knee and 4 combined knee-ankle prostheses were identified. While an active prosthesis may help to restore the functional performance of an amputee, the requirements regarding the actuation unit as well as for the control system are high and the development becomes a challenging task. Regarding mechanical design and the actuation unit high force/torque delivery, high efficiency, low size and low weight are conflicting goals. The actuation principle and variable impedance actuators are discussed. The control system is paramount for a ``natural functioning'' of the prosthesis. The control system has to enable locomotion and should react to the amputee's intent. For this, multi-level control approaches are reviewed.},

Although effective at their intended gait speed and terrain, these controllers do not allow for adaptation to environmental disturbances such as speed transients and terrain variation. Here we present an adaptive muscle-reflex controller, based on simulation studies, that utilizes an ankle plantar flexor comprising a Hill-type muscle with a positive force feedback reflex. The model's parameters were fitted to match the human ankle's torque-angle profile as obtained from level-ground walking measurements of a weight and height-matched intact subject walking at 1 m/s. Using this single parameter set, clinical trials were conducted with a transtibial amputee walking on level ground, ramp ascent, and ramp descent conditions. During these trials, an adaptation of prosthetic ankle work was observed in response to ground slope variation, in a manner comparable to intact subjects, without the difficulties of explicit terrain sensing. Specifically, the energy provided by the prosthesis was directly correlated to the ground slope angle. This study highlights the importance of neuromuscular controllers for enhancing the adaptiveness of powered prosthetic devices across varied terrain surfaces.},

  abstract = {High-frame-rate ultrasonography based on coherent compounding of unfocused beams can potentially transform the assessment of cardiac function. As it requires successive waves to be combined coherently, this approach is sensitive to high-velocity tissue motion. We investigated coherent compounding of tilted diverging waves, emitted from a 2.5 MHz clinical phased array transducer. To cope with high myocardial velocities, a triangle transmit sequence of diverging waves is proposed, combined with tissue Doppler imaging to perform motion compensation (MoCo). The compound sequence with integrated MoCo was adjusted from simulations and was tested in vitro and in vivo. Realistic myocardial velocities were analyzed in an in vitro spinning disk with anechoic cysts. While a 8 dB decrease (no motion versus high motion) was observed without MoCo, the contrast-to-noise ratio of the cysts was preserved with the MoCo approach. With this method, we could provide high-quality in vivo B-mode cardiac images with tissue Doppler at 250 frames per second. Although the septum and the anterior mitral leaflet were poorly apparent without MoCo, they became well perceptible and well contrasted with MoCo. The septal and lateral mitral annulus velocities determined by tissue Doppler were concordant with those measured by pulsed-wave Doppler with a clinical scanner (r2= 0.7, y = 09.x + 0.5, N = 60). To conclude, high-contrast echo-cardiographic B-mode and tissue Doppler images can be obtained with diverging beams when motion compensation is integrated in the coherent compounding process.},

This technique is based on the combination of a radiation force induced in tissues by focused ultrasonic beams and a very high frame rate ultrasound imaging sequence capable of catching in real time the transient propagation of resulting shear waves. The local shear wave velocity is recovered using a dedicated time-of-flight estimation technique and enables the 2-D quantitative mapping of shear elasticity. This imaging modality is performed using a conventional ultrasound probe during a standard intercostal ultrasonographic examination. Three supersonic shear imaging (SSI) sequences are applied successively in the left, middle and right parts of the 2-D ultrasonographic image. Resulting shear elasticity images in the three regions are concatenated to provide the final image covering the entire region-of-interest. The ability of the SSI technique to provide a quantitative and local estimation of liver shear modulus with a millimetric resolution is proven in vivo on 15 healthy volunteers. Liver moduli extracted from in vivo data from healthy volunteers are consistent with those reported in the literature (Young's modulus ranging from 4 to 7.5 kPa). Moreover, liver stiffness estimation using the SSI mode is shown to be fast (less than one second), repeatable (5.7\% standard deviation) and reproducible (6.7\% standard deviation). This technique, used as a complementary tool for B-mode ultrasound, could complement morphologic information both for fibrosis staging and hepatic lesions imaging (E-mail: jl.gennisson@espci.fr).},

  abstract = {In elastography, quantitative imaging of soft tissue elastic properties is provided by local shear wave speed estimation. Shear wave imaging in a homogeneous medium thicker than the shear wavelength is eased by a simple relationship between shear wave speed and local shear modulus. In thin layered organs, the shear wave is guided and thus undergoes dispersive effects. This case is encountered in medical applications such as elastography of skin layers, corneas, or arterial walls. In this work, we proposed and validated shear wave spectroscopy as a method for elastic modulus quantification in such layered tissues. Shear wave dispersion curves in thin layers were obtained by finite-difference simulations and numerical solving of the boundary conditions. In addition, an analytical approximation of the dispersion equation was derived from the leaky Lamb wave theory. In vitro dispersion curves obtained from phantoms were consistent with numerical studies (deviation $<$;1.4\%). The least-mean-squares fitting of the dispersion curves enables a quantitative and accurate (error $<$;5\% of the transverse speed) assessment of the elasticity. Dispersion curves were also found to be poorly influenced by shear viscosity.

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable estimation of muscle moment arms is a prerequisite for the development of musculoskeletal models. Numerous techniques are available to estimate the Achilles tendon moment arm in vivo. The purposes of this study were 1) to compare in vivo Achilles tendon moment arms obtained using the center of rotation (COR) and tendon excursion (TE) methods and 2) to assess the reliability of each method. For the COR method, magnetic resonance (MR) images from nine participants were obtained at ankle angles of -15$^\circ$, 0$^\circ$, and +15$^\circ$ and analyzed using Reuleaux' method. For the TE method, the movement of the gastrocnemius medialis-Achilles tendon junction was recorded using ultrasonography as the ankle was passively rotated through its range of motion. The Achilles tendon moment arm was obtained by differentiation of tendon displacement with respect to ankle angular excursion using seven different differentiation techniques. Moment arms obtained using the COR method were significantly greater than those obtained using the TE method (P $<$ 0.01), but results from both methods were well correlated. The coefficient of determination between moment arms derived from the COR and TE methods was highest when tendon displacement was linearly differentiated over a $\pm$10$^\circ$ interval (R2 = 0.94). The between-measurement coefficient of variation was 3.9\% for the COR method and 4.5\textendash{}9.7\% for the TE method, depending on the differentiation technique. The high reliabilities and strong relationship between methods demonstrate that both methods are robust against their limitations. The large absolute between-method differences ($\sim$25\textendash{}30\%) in moment arms have significant implications for their use in musculoskeletal models.},

Two methods were employed, both of them based on the assumption that the ankle joint complex and TA muscle\vphantom\{\}tendon unit operate in the sagittal plane. Using method A, moment arms were obtained from MR scans of the foot by measuring the perpendicular distance between a moving centre of rotation in the talo-crural joint and the TA tendon action line. Using method B, moment arms were calculated from the ratio of TA tendon displacement, which was estimated from a planimetric muscle model using pennation angles and muscle thickness measured by ultrasonography, to the tibial rotation around the talus, which was measured from the foot MR scans. Using either of the two methods at rest, the estimated TA moment arm decreased from \&4.5 to \&2.9 cm in the transition from dorsi\#exion to plantar\#exion. Using method A, moment arms during MVC were larger by 0.9\vphantom\{\}1.5 cm (33\vphantom\{\}44\%, P(0.01) than the respective resting estimations. In contrast, no di!erence (P'0.05) was found between the resting and MVC moment arm estimations of method B. Limitations in the oversimpli"ed musculoskeletal model used raise questions for the validity of both method estimations. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A system of mechanical stops, support triangles and velcro straps was used to secure the subject in the above positions. Location of a moving centre of rotation was calculated for ankle rotations from -30 to 0 deg, -15 to +15 deg, 0 to +30 deg and +15 to +45 deg. All instant centres of rotation were calculated both at rest and during MVC. Achilles tendon moment arms were measured at ankle angles of -15, 0, +15 and +30 deg. 3 At any given ankle angle, Achilles tendon moment arm length during MVC increased by 1-1.5 cm (22-27 \%, P $<$ 0.01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both Achilles tendon by 0.6-1.1 cm (P $<$ 0.01) and all instant centres of rotation by about 0.3 cm (P $<$ 0.05) away from their corresponding resting positions. 4 The findings of this study have important implications for estimating loads in the musculoskeletal system. Substantially unrealistic Achilles tendon forces and moments generated around the ankle joint during a plantarflexor MVC would be calculated using resting Achilles tendon moment arm measurements.},

Methods: Shear modulus of the biceps brachii was determined using ultrasound shear-wave elastography during static elbow flexion (up to 60\% of maximal contraction) in healthy young adults. Results: The correspondence of shear modulus was confirmed in phantoms between the manufacturer-calibrated values and the shear-wave elastography values. The intraclass correlation coefficient of muscle shear modulus was high: 0.978 between trials and 0.948 between days. Shear modulus increased linearly with elbow flexion torque across contraction intensity, and its slope was associated negatively with muscle strength. Conclusions: Muscle shear modulus measured with ultrasound shear-wave elastography may be useful for inferring muscle stiffness across a wide range of contraction intensity. In addition, it has high repeatability between trials and between days. Muscle Nerve 50: 103\textendash{}113, 2014},

Since both these pathways are constrained by physics, the activity of neural circuits can only be understood by considering biomechanics of muscles, bodies, and the exterior world. We discuss how animal bodies have natural stable motions that require relatively little activation or control from the nervous system. The nervous system can substantially alter these motions, by subtly changing mechanical properties such as body or leg stiffness. Mechanics can also provide robustness to perturbations without sensory reflexes. By considering a complete neuromechanical system, neuroscientists and biomechanicians together can provide a more integrated view of neural circuitry and behavior.},

Recent advances in experimental techniques allow in vivo measurements of muscle\textendash{}tendon architecture and function. In particular, the use of ultrasonography for measurement of tendon and muscle has expanded our knowledge in the last decade. Furthermore, the nuclear magnetic resonance imaging is opening up new insights not only for three-dimensional anatomical information but also for examining musculo-skeletal motion in vivo. While these two completely non-invasive methods provide kinematic data, in vivo force measurements still require somewhat invasive procedures and are scarce. Thus, muscle forces are frequently calculated using both simple and complex models. These models can give us suggestions for further experimental work. There is a need to examine the experimental data ranging from single-fiber experiments to the muscle function in human movement in order to understand the muscle\textendash{}tendon function in vivo fully. Furthermore, appreciation of the structure\textendash{}function relationships may help us to understand the entity of muscle\textendash{}tendon function both from the perspective of mechanical behavior and neural control.},

In this paper, previous work on in vivo measurements of human muscle-tendon moment arms at rest and during isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) is reviewed. The results obtained by actual measurements on 2-D magnetic resonance images indicate that the moment arm lengths of the Achilles and tibialis anterior tendons increase during MVC compared with rest by between 22\% and 44\%, due to (1) joint displacement, (2) muscle thickening and (3) stretching of collagenous structures mediating the action of tendon. However, moment arm length calculations based on the virtual work principle fail to show the above effect. Potentially severe mechanical limitations of the latter method as adapted under in vivo conditions raise questions about its validity during muscle contraction.},

Eighty healthy subjects over 18 years of age were prospectively included. Data on the patients' height, weight, sporting activities, and take-off foot were assessed. The thickness, width, and cross-sectional area of the calcaneal tendons were measured. The shear wave propagation velocity (Vmean) was measured by three radiologists on axial and sagittal SWE images at four different degrees of ankle flexion, enabling to calculate elasticity modulus (Emean), and relative anisotropy coefficient (A) values.ResultsIn complete plantar flexion, Vmean was 6.8 $\pm$ 1.4 m.s-1 and 5.1 $\pm$ 0.8 m.s-1, respectively, on the sagittal and axial SWE image, resulting in an elastographic anisotropy A of 0.24 $\pm$ 0.16. The best interobserver correlation coefficient of Emean and Vmean was 0.43 and 0.46, respectively, in the sagittal SWE for complete plantar flexion. Vmean and Emean significantly increase when the tendon is stretched by ankle dorsiflexion. The maximal values in sagittal SWE were Vmean = 16.1 $\pm$ 0.7 m.s-1, Emean = 779.5 $\pm$ 57.1kPa and A = 0.63 $\pm$ 0.07.ConclusionsSWE allows the elastic properties of the calcaneal tendon to be evaluated quantitatively in vivo, but interobserver reproducibility is questionable. It confirms the tendinous elastographic anisotropy and stiffness augmentation of stretched tendon.},

  abstract = {This paper examined if an electromyography (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model of the human knee could be used to predict knee moments, calculated using inverse dynamics, across a varied range of dynamic contractile conditions. Muscle\textendash{}tendon lengths and moment arms of 13 muscles crossing the knee joint were determined from joint kinematics using a three-dimensional anatomical model of the lower limb. Muscle activation was determined using a second-order discrete non-linear model using rectified and lowpass filtered EMG as input. A modified Hill-type muscle model was used to calculate individual muscle forces using activation and muscle tendon lengths as inputs. The model was calibrated to six individuals by altering a set of physiologically based parameters using mathematical optimisation to match the net flexion/extension (FE) muscle moment with those measured by inverse dynamics. The model was calibrated for each subject using 5 different tasks, including passive and active FE in an isokinetic dynamometer, running, and cutting manoeuvres recorded using three-dimensional motion analysis. Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the FE moments, estimated via inverse dynamics, from over 200 isokinetic dynamometer, running and sidestepping tasks. The inverse dynamics joint moments were predicted with an average R2 of 0.91 and mean residual error of B12 Nm. A re-calibration of only the EMG-to-activation parameters revealed FE moments prediction across weeks of similar accuracy. Changing the muscle model to one that is more physiologically correct produced better predictions. The modelling method presented represents a good way to estimate in vivo muscle forces during movement tasks.},

  abstract = {Background: Quantifying increased joint resistance into its contributing factors i.e. stiffness and viscosity (``hypertonia'') and stretch reflexes (``hyperreflexia'') is important in stroke rehabilitation. Existing clinical tests, such as the Ashworth Score, do not permit discrimination between underlying tissue and reflexive (neural) properties. We propose an instrumented identification paradigm for early and tailor made interventions.
Methods: Ramp-and-Hold ankle dorsiflexion rotations of various durations were imposed using a manipulator. A one second rotation over the Range of Motion similar to the Ashworth condition was included. Tissue stiffness and viscosity and reflexive torque were estimated using a nonlinear model and compared to the Ashworth Score of nineteen stroke patients and seven controls.
Results: Ankle viscosity moderately increased, stiffness was indifferent and reflexive torque decreased with movement duration. Compared to controls, patients with an Ashworth Score of 1 and 2+ were significantly stiffer and had higher viscosity and patients with an Ashworth Score of 2+ showed higher reflexive torque. For the one second movement, stiffness correlated to Ashworth Score (r2 = 0.51, F = 32.7, p $<$ 0.001) with minor uncorrelated reflexive torque. Reflexive torque correlated to Ashworth Score at shorter movement durations (r2 = 0.25, F = 11, p = 0.002).
Conclusion: Stroke patients were distinguished from controls by tissue stiffness and viscosity and to a lesser extent by reflexive torque from the soleus muscle. These parameters were also sensitive to discriminate patients, clinically graded by the Ashworth Score. Movement duration affected viscosity and reflexive torque which are clinically relevant parameters. Full evaluation of pathological joint resistance therefore requires instrumented tests at various movement conditions.},

  abstract = {Objective. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm increases during maximum isometric dorsiflexion as compared with rest. Background. In musculoskeletal modelling applications, moment arms from passive muscles at rest are assumed representative of those measured during isometric muscle contraction. The validity of this assumption is questionable in musculotendon actuators enclosed by retinacular systems as in tibialis anterior. Design and methods. Sagittal-plane magnetic resonance images of the right ankle were taken in six subjects at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion at six ankle angles between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion having the body placed in the supine position and the knee flexed at 90$^\circ$. Instant centres of rotation in the tibio-talar joint, tibialis anterior tendon action lines and moment arms were identified in the sagittal plane at ankle angles of -15$^\circ$, 0$^\circ$,+15$^\circ$ and +30$^\circ$ at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion. Results. At any given ankle angle, the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm during maximum isometric dorsiflexion increased by 0.9\textendash{}1.5 cm (P$<$0.01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both tibialis anterior tendon action line by 0.8\textendash{}1.2 cm (P$<$0.01) and all instant centres of rotation by 0.3\textendash{}0.4 cm (P$<$0.01) distally in relation to their corresponding resting positions. Conclusions and implications. The assumption that the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm does not change from rest to maximum isometric dorsiflexion is invalid. Erroneous tendon forces, muscle stresses and joint moments by as much as 30\% would be calculated using resting tibialis anterior tendon moment arms in the moment equilibrium equation around the ankle joint during maximum isometric dorsiflexion. Relevance A substantial increase in the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm occurs from rest to maximum isometric dorsiflexion. This needs to be taken into consideration when using planimetric musculoskeletal modelling for analysing maximal static ankle dorsiflexion loads.},

  abstract = {Hemodynamic changes in the brain are often used as surrogates of neuronal activity to infer the loci of brain activity. A major limitation of conventional Doppler ultrasound for the imaging of these changes is that it is not sensitive enough to detect the blood flow in small vessels where the major part of the hemodynamic response occurs. Here, we present a $\mu$Doppler ultrasound method able to detect and map the cerebral blood volume (CBV) over the entire brain with an important increase in sensitivity. This method is based on imaging the brain at an ultrafast frame rate (1 kHz) using compounded plane wave emissions. A theoretical model demonstrates that the gain in sensitivity of the $\mu$Doppler method is due to the combination of 1) the high signal-to-noise ratio of the gray scale images, resulting from the synthetic compounding of backscattered echoes; and 2) the extensive signal averaging enabled by the high temporal sampling of ultrafast frame rates. This $\mu$Doppler imaging is performed in vivo on trepanned rats without the use of contrast agents. The resulting images reveal detailed maps of the rat brain vascularization with an acquisition time as short as 320 ms per slice. This new method is the basis for a real-time functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging of the brain.},

Plantar flexion perturbations were presented in late stance while able-bodied human subjects walked on a treadmill that was declined by 4\%, inclined by 4\% or held level. The plantar flexion perturbation produced a transient, but marked, presumably spinally mediated decrease in soleus EMG that varied directly with the treadmill inclination. Similarly, the magnitude of the control step soleus EMG and Achilles' tendon force also varied directly with the treadmill inclination. In contrast, the ankle angular displacement and velocity were inversely related to the treadmill inclination. These results suggest that Golgi tendon organ feedback, via the group Ib pathway, is reduced when the muscle\textendash{}tendon complex is unloaded by a rapid plantar flexion perturbation in late stance phase. The changes in the unload response with treadmill inclination suggest that the late stance phase soleus activity may be enhanced by force feedback.},

Reviewed data do not support the assertion commonly made in PNF literature that contraction of a stretched muscle prior to further stretch, or contraction of opposing muscles during muscle stretch, produces relaxation of the stretched muscle. Further, following contraction of a stretched muscle, inhibition of the stretch reflex response lasts only 1 s. Studies examined suggested that decreases in the response amplitude of the Hoffmann and muscle stretch reflexes following a contraction of a stretched muscle are not due to the activation of Golgi tendon organs, as commonly purported, but instead may be due to presynaptic inhibition of the muscle spindle sensory signal. The current view on the complex manner by which the spinal cord processes proprioceptive signals was discussed. The ability of acute PNF stretching procedures to often produce a joint range of motion greater than that observed with static stretching must be explained by mechanisms other than the spinal processing of proprioceptive information. Studies reviewed indicate that changes in the ability to tolerate stretch and/or the viscoelastic properties of the stretched muscle, induced by PNF procedures, are possible mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Humans maneuver easily over uneven terrain. To maintain smooth and efficient gait the motor system needs to adapt the locomotor output to the walking environment. In the present study we investigate the role of sensory feedback in adjusting the soleus muscle activity during overground walking in 19 healthy volunteers. Subjects walked unrestrained over a hydraulically actuated platform. On random trials the platform was accelerated downward at 0.8 g, unloading the plantar flexor muscles in midstance or late stance. The drop of the platform resulted in a significant depression of the soleus muscle activity of -17.9\% (SD 2) and -21.4\% (SD 2), with an onset latency of 49 ms (SD 1) and 45 ms (SD 1) in midstance and late stance, respectively. Input to the vestibular apparatus (i.e., the head acceleration) occurred at a latency 10.0 ms (SD 2.4) following the drop and ankle dorsiflexion velocity was decreased starting 22 ms (SD 15) after the drop. To investigate the role of length- and velocity-sensitive afferents on the depression in soleus muscle activity, the ankle rotation was arrested by using an ankle foot orthotic as the platform was dropped. Preventing the ankle movement did not significantly change the soleus depression in late stance [-18.2\% (SD 15)], whereas the depression in midstance was removed [+4.9\% (SD 13)]. It is concluded that force feedback from ankle extensors increases the locomotor output through positive feedback in late stance. In midstance the effect of force feedback was not observed, suggesting that spindle afferents may have a more significant effect on the output during this phase of the step cycle.},

  doi = {10.1152/jn.00374.2016},
  abstract = {Muscle spindles provide exquisitely sensitive proprioceptive information regarding joint position and movement. Through passively driven length changes in the muscle-tendon unit (MTU), muscle spindles detect joint rotations because of their in-parallel mechanical linkage to muscle fascicles. In human microneurography studies, muscle fascicles are assumed to follow the MTU and, as such, fascicle length is not measured in such studies. However, under certain mechanical conditions, compliant structures can act to decouple the fascicles, and, therefore, the spindles, from the MTU. Such decoupling may reduce the fidelity by which muscle spindles encode joint position and movement. The aim of the present study was to measure, for the first time, both the changes in firing of single muscle spindle afferents and changes in muscle fascicle length in vivo from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) during passive rotations about the ankle. Unitary recordings were made from 15 muscle spindle afferents supplying TA via a microelectrode inserted into the common peroneal nerve. Ultrasonography was used to measure the length of an individual fascicle of TA. We saw a strong correlation between fascicle length and firing rate during passive ankle rotations of varying rates (0.1\textendash{}0.5 Hz) and amplitudes (1\textendash{}9$^\circ$). In particular, we saw responses observed at relatively small changes in muscle length that highlight the sensitivity of the TA muscle to small length changes. This study is the first to measure spindle firing and fascicle dynamics in vivo and provides an experimental basis for further understanding the link between fascicle length, MTU length, and spindle firing patterns.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Muscle spindles are exquisitely sensitive to changes in muscle length, but recordings from human muscle spindle afferents are usually correlated with joint angle rather than muscle fascicle length. In this study, we monitored both muscle fascicle length and spindle firing from the human tibialis anterior muscle in vivo. Our findings are the first to measure these signals in vivo and provide an experimental basis for exploring this link further.},

  abstract = {A constant coordination between the left and right leg is required to maintain stability during human locomotion, especially in a variable environment. The neural mechanisms underlying this interlimb coordination are not yet known. In animals, interneurons located within the spinal cord allow direct communication between the two sides without the need for the involvement of higher centers. These may also exist in humans since sensory feedback elicited by tibial nerve stimulation on one side (ipsilateral) can affect the muscles activation in the opposite side (contralateral), provoking short-latency crossed responses (SLCRs). The current study investigated whether contralateral afferent feedback contributes to the mechanism controlling the SLCR in human gastrocnemius muscle. Surface electromyogram, kinematic and kinetic data were recorded from subjects during normal walking and hybrid walking (with the legs moving in opposite directions). An inverse dynamics model was applied to estimate the gastrocnemius muscle proprioceptors' firing rate. During normal walking, a significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of SLCRs and the estimated muscle spindle secondary afferent activity (P = 0.04). Moreover, estimated spindle secondary afferent and Golgi tendon organ activity were significantly different (P $\leq$ 0.01) when opposite responses have been observed, that is during normal (facilitation) and hybrid walking (inhibition) conditions. Contralateral sensory feedback, specifically spindle secondary afferents, likely plays a significant role in generating the SLCR. This observation has important implications for our understanding of what future research should be focusing on to optimize locomotor recovery in patient populations.},

A similar experiment was performed with a subject who lacked proprioception and touch sensation from the neck down. In contrast with healthy subjects, no muscle activation changes were observed in the deafferented subject.

In the present study, serial magnetic resonance images were taken every 10 mm along the lower leg of 8 male subjects to calculate the volume and subsequently the PCSAs of the individual muscles producing plantar flexor and dorsiflexor torques. Maximum plantar flexor and dorsiflexor voluntary isometric torques were determined at ankle joint angles of 90, 100, 110, and 120 degrees. Peak tendon force estimated from torque and moment arm measurements was more than fourfold higher in the plantar flexors (3,623 +/- 136 N) than in the dorsiflexors (832 +/- 19 N). PCSAs were about eight- and threefold higher than the anatomic cross-sectional areas at the level of maximum girth of the calf for the plantar flexor and dorsiflexor groups, respectively. Mean muscle volume and PCSA were 4.6 and 12 times larger in the plantar flexors compared with the dorsiflexors, respectively. The PCSAs of both plantar flexors (r = 0.92) and dorsiflexors (r = 0.80) were highly correlated with the tendon tension of the respective muscle groups. The maximum specific tension was more than twofold higher in dorsiflexors than in plantar flexors. These data suggest that factors other than PCSA contribute to the force output potential of ankle plantar flexors and dorsiflexors in humans.},

  abstract = {In the past 20 years, the use of ultrasound-based methods has become a standard approach to measure tendon mechanical properties in vivo. Yet the multitude of methodological approaches adopted by various research groups probably contribute to the large variability of reported values. The technique of obtaining and relating tendon deformation to tensile force in vivo has been applied differently, depending on practical constraints or scientific points of view. Divergence can be seen in 1) methodological considerations, such as the choice of anatomical features to scan and to track, force measurements, or signal synchronization; and 2) in physiological considerations related to the viscoelastic behavior or length measurements of tendons. Hence, the purpose of the present review is to assess and discuss the physiological and technical aspects connected to in vivo testing of tendon mechanical properties. In doing so, our aim is to provide the reader with a qualitative analysis of ultrasound-based techniques. Finally, a list of recommendations is proposed for a number of selected issues.},

  abstract = {In addition to changes in the central nervous system, many changes can occur in the composition and structure of skeletal muscles after a hemispheric stroke. The mechanical behavior of skeletal muscles is linked to the density and structural arrangement of key constituents. Yet, little is known about changes in post-stroke muscle mechanical properties such as viscoelasticity. The aim of this study was to explore the frequency-dependent changes in shear wave (SW) velocity as a potentially informative feature accompanying changes in muscle viscoelastic properties under passive and active conditions in hemiplegic stroke. We used the ultrasound SuperSonic Imaging technique to induce and measure SW propagation in the biceps brachii muscle for both the paretic and contralateral limbs in three hemiplegic stroke survivors during passive and submaximal voluntary muscle contractions. We found that for all subjects, the muscles on both the paretic and non-paretic sides demonstrated large dispersion (i.e., a change in SW phase velocities as a function of frequency within each contraction level) under both passive and active conditions, although muscles on the paretic side displayed larger dispersion. In addition, for a range of frequencies from 108\textendash{}756 Hz, the SW phase velocity was higher in active nonparetic muscles compared to those of paretic side with an increase of 42\% at 756 Hz. This is in contrast with the muscle response under passive condition where the SW phase velocity exhibited a 97 \% increase at 765Hz on the paretic side compared to the non-paretic side. These results suggest the mechanical properties are altered for stroke-affected muscles, which may be a result of changes in the muscle extracellular matrix composition. Further, this study provides evidence that there are changes in tissue mechanical properties and that may consequently influence muscle function.},

We investigated the capability of shear wave elastography (SWE) to measure variations in gastrocnemius shear wave speed induced via active contraction and passive stretch. Ten healthy young adults were tested. Shear wave speeds were measured using a SWE transducer positioned over the medial gastrocnemius at ankle angles ranging from maximum dorsiflexion to maximum plantarflexion. Shear wave speeds were also measured during voluntary plantarflexor contractions at a fixed ankle angle. Average shear wave speed increased significantly from 2.6 to 5.6 m s \textendash{}1 with passive dorsiflexion and the knee in an extended posture, but did not vary with dorsiflexion when the gastrocnemius was shortened in a flexed knee posture. During active contractions, shear wave speed monotonically varied with the net ankle moment generated, reaching 8.3 m s \textendash{}1 in the maximally contracted condition. There was a linear correlation between shear wave speed and net ankle moment in both the active and passive conditions; however, the slope of this linear relationship was significantly steeper for the data collected during passive loading conditions. The results show that SWE is a promising approach for quantitatively assessing changes in mechanical muscle loading. However, the differential effect of active and passive loading on shear wave speed makes it important to carefully consider the relevant loading conditions in which to use SWE to characterize in vivo muscle properties.},

  abstract = {As a result of a brain injury such as stroke, the skeletal muscles may undergo numerous structural and functional alterations. These abnormal changes are linked to muscle weakness, joint contracture, and abnormal muscle tone and eventually, result in motor impairment. A subset of these alterations affects passive muscle stiffness, i.e., viscoelastic properties. However, in vivo estimation of changes in viscoelastic properties is a challenging task. Here, we used the shear wave velocity, estimated through ultrasound SuperSonic imaging (SSI), as a surrogate for viscoelastic properties. We estimated shear wave group and phase velocities (dispersion), and thus, quantified both elasticity and viscosity of the muscle tissue, respectively in muscles of hemiplegic stroke survivors. In these individuals, we found significantly higher group and phase velocities in the stroke-affected muscles (p$<$; 05) compared to those of the contralateral non-affected side. We hypothesize that in addition to changes in neural and contractile properties, there are also, changes in elastic and tissue dispersive properties through local mechanisms. An enhanced understanding of post-stroke changes in skeletal muscles will lead to better and targeted interventions for rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Muscle shear elastic modulus is linearly related to muscle torque during low-level contractions ($<$60\% of Maximal Voluntary Contraction, MVC). This measurement can therefore be used to estimate changes in individual muscle force. However, it is not known if this relationship remains valid for higher intensities. The aim of this study was to determine: (i) the relationship between muscle shear elastic modulus and muscle torque over the entire range of isometric contraction and (ii) the influence of the size of the region of interest (ROI) used to average the shear modulus value. Ten healthy males performed two incremental isometric little finger abductions. The joint torque produced by Abductor Digiti Minimi was considered as an index of muscle torque and elastic modulus. A high coefficient of determination (R2) (range: 0.86\textendash{}0.98) indicated that the relationship between elastic modulus and torque can be accurately modeled by a linear regression over the entire range (0\% to 100\% of MVC). The changes in shear elastic modulus as a function of torque were highly repeatable. Lower R2 values (0.89$\pm$0.13 for 1/16 of ROI) and significantly increased absolute errors were observed when the shear elastic modulus was averaged over smaller ROI, half, 1/4 and 1/16 of the full ROI) than the full ROI (mean size: 1.18$\pm$0.24cm2). It suggests that the ROI should be as large as possible for accurate measurement of muscle shear modulus.},

  abstract = {Elastic properties of tendon were assessed by two different approaches. Six fresh bovine Achilles tendon specimens were used. The first approach directly measured Young's modulus along the transverse direction (Eperpendicular) and the longitudinal direction (Eparallel), using a cyclic compression\textendash{}relaxation method. Young's moduli were derived based on the measured strain and stress values. The ratio of Eparallel: Eperpendicular at smaller strains was around 4 and decreased to 0.6$\sim$1.1 at larger strains. The second approach assumed that tendons are transversely isotropic. Three observable second-order elastic stiffness constants (c11, c13 and c33) were obtained by sound speed measurements along various propagation directions. The measured elastic stiffness constants were also correlated with results from the first approach. It was shown that the transverse isotropy assumption was valid at small strains. However, a significant discrepancy existed between the two approaches. The discrepancy was primarily due to viscoelasticity associated with the first approach. (E-mail: paichi@cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw)},

We performed the forward problem analysis, the inverse problem analysis, and experiments. In the forward problem analysis, the shear wave speeds at different frequencies were calculated using the Voigt model for given shear elasticity and varying shear viscosity. In the inverse problem analysis, the viscoelastic parameters were estimated from the given wave speeds for the five viscoelastic models using the least-square regression. The experiment was performed in a tissue-mimicking phantom. A local harmonic vibration was generated via a mechanical shaker on the phantom at five frequencies (100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 Hz) and an ultrasound transducer was used to capture the tissue motion. Shear wave speed of the phantom was measured using the ultrasound shear wave elastography technique. The parameters for different viscoelastic models for the phantom were identified. For both analytical and experimental studies, ratios of storage to loss modulus as a function of excitation frequency for different viscoelastic models were calculated. We found that the Voigt and fractional Voigt models fit well with the shear wave speed - frequency and ratio of storage to loss modulus \textendash{} frequency relationships both in analytical and experimental studies.},

Four positions were defined to evaluate shear modulus in 10 healthy subjects: parallel to the fibers, in the anterior and posterior aspects of the lower limb, at rest and during passive stretching. Reliability was first evaluated on two muscles by three operators; these measurements were repeated six times. Then, measurement reliability was compared in 11 muscles by two operators; these measurements were repeated three times. Reproducibility of shear modulus was 0.48 kPa and repeatability was 0.41 kPa, with all muscles pooled. Position did not significantly influence reliability.

The analysis of g\textsuperscript{(1)} (,\textsubscript{t}) measured on the human M. \emph{biceps brachii} during repetitive electrical stimulation, using optical properties measured with time-resolved reflectance spectroscopy, shows that the tissue dynamics giving rise to the speckle fluctuations can be described by a combination of diffusion and shearing.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method to model the shear wave propagation in transversely isotropic, viscoelastic and incompressible media. The targeted application is ultrasound-based shear wave elastography for viscoelasticity measurements in anisotropic tissues such as the kidney and skeletal muscles. The proposed model predicts that if the viscoelastic parameters both across and along fiber directions can be characterized as a Voigt material, then the spatial phase velocity at any angle is also governed by a Voigt material model. Further, with the aid of Taylor expansions, it is shown that the spatial group velocity at any angle is close to a Voigt type for weakly attenuative materials within a certain bandwidth. The model is implemented in a finite element code by a time domain explicit integration scheme and shear wave simulations are conducted. The results of the simulations are analyzed to extract the shear wave elasticity and viscosity for both the spatial phase and group velocities. The estimated values match well with theoretical predictions. The proposed theory is further verified by an ex vivo tissue experiment measured in a porcine skeletal muscle by an ultrasound shear wave elastography method. The applicability of the Taylor expansion to analyze the spatial velocities is also discussed. We demonstrate that the approximations from the Taylor expansions are subject to errors when the viscosities across or along the fiber directions are large or the maximum frequency considered is beyond the bandwidth defined by radii of convergence of the Taylor expansions.},

  abstract = {We investigated alterations in material properties such as elasticity and viscoelasticity of stroke-affected muscles using ultrasound induced shear waves and mechanical models. We used acoustic radiation force to generate shear waves along fascicles of biceps muscles and measured their propagation velocity. The shear wave data were collected in muscles of 13 hemiplegic stroke survivors under passive conditions at 90$^\circ$, 120$^\circ$, and 150$^\circ$ elbow flexion angles. In a viscoelastic medium, as opposed to a purely elastic medium, the shear wave propagation velocity depends on the frequency content of the induced wave. Therefore, in addition to the shear wave group velocity (GpV), we also estimated a frequency-dependent phase velocity (PhV). We found significantly higher GpVs and PhVs in stroke-affected muscles (\$p $<$ 0.05\$). The velocity data were used to estimate shear elasticity and viscosity using an elastic and viscoelastic material models. A pure elastic model showed increased shear elasticity in stroke-affected muscles (\$p $<$ 0.05\$). The Voigt model estimates of viscoelastic properties were also significantly different between the stroke-impaired and non-impaired muscles. We observed significantly larger model-estimated viscosity values on the stroke-affected side at elbow flexion angles of 120$^\circ$ and 150$^\circ$. Furthermore, the creep behavior (tissue strain resulting from the application of sudden constant stress) of the model was also different between muscles of the paretic and non-paretic side. We speculate that these changes are associated with the structural disruption of muscles after stroke and may potentially affect force generation from muscle fibers as well as transmission of force to tendons.},

For muscular diagnostic applications, characteristics of the shear wave profile will strongly depend on characteristics of the transducer as well as the orientation of muscular fibers and the tissue viscoelastic properties. The numerical simulation of shear waves generated from a specific probe in an anisotropic viscoelastic medium is a key issue for further developments of SWE in fibrous soft tissues. In this study we propose a complete numerical tool allowing 3D simulation of a shear wave front in anisotropic viscoelastic media. From the description of an ultrasonic transducer, the shear wave source is simulated by using Field's II software and shear wave propagation described by using the Green's formalism. Finally, the comparison between simulations and experiments are successively performed for both shear wave velocity and dispersion profile in a transverse isotropic hydrogel phantom, in vivo forearm muscle and in vivo biceps brachii.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Achilles tendon is the most frequently ruptured tendon, but its optimal treatment is increasingly controversial. The mechanical properties of the healing tendon should be studied further. Shear waves elastography (SWE) measures the shear modulus, which is proven to be correlated to elastic modulus in animal tendons. The aim of our study was to study whether the shear moduli of human cadaveric Achilles tendon, given by SWE, were correlated with the apparent elastic moduli of those tendons given by tensile tests.
Materials and methods
Fourteen cadaveric lower-limbs were studied. An elastographic study of the Achilles tendon (AT) was first done in clinical-like conditions. SWE was performed at three successive levels (0, 3 and 6cm from tendon insertion) with elastographic probe oriented parallel to tendon fibers, blindly, for three standardized ankle positions (25$^\circ$ plantar flexion, neutral position, and maximal dorsal flexion). The mean shear moduli were collected through blind offline data-analysis. Then, AT with triceps were harvested. They were subjected to tensile tests. A continuous SWE of the Achilles tendon was performed simultaneously. The apparent elastic modulus was obtained from the experimental stress-strain curve, and correlation with shear modulus (given by SWE) was studied.
Results
Average shear moduli of harvested AT, given by SWE made an instant before the tensile tests, were significantly correlated with shear moduli of the same AT made at the same level, previously in clinical-like condition (p$<$0.05), only in neutral position. There was a statistical correlation (p$<$0.005) and a correlation coefficient R$^2$ equal to 0.95$\pm$0.05, between shear moduli (SWE) and apparent elastic moduli (tensile tests), for 11 tendons (3 tendons were inoperable due to technical error), before a constant disruption in the correlation curves.
Discussion
We demonstrated a significant correlation between SWE of Achilles tendon performed in clinical-like conditions (in neutral position) and SWE performed in harvested tendon. We also found a correlation between SWE performed on harvested tendon and apparent elastic moduli obtained with tensile tests (for 11 specimens). As a consequence, we can suppose that SWE of AT in clinical-like conditions is related to tensile tests. To our knowledge, the ability of SWE to reliably assess biomechanical properties of a tendon or muscle was, so far, only demonstrated in animal models.
Conclusion
SWE can provide biomechanical information of the human AT non-invasively.},

As such, it can provide a valuable tool for understanding how muscle, tendon, and ligament mechanics influence the way we move, or vice versa, in health and disease, or to understand how and why these tissues might get injured due to chronic or acute loading. This chapter explores the basic concepts of ultrasound and how it can be used to examine muscle, tendon, and ligament structure and mechanical function. It introduces different techniques, like conventional B-mode imaging, threedimensional ultrasound, and various forms of elastography that can be used to quantify geometrical and mechanical properties of the muscle, tendon, and ligament. Furthermore, methods to quantify muscle and tendon mechanical function during dynamic human movement are explored, and recommendations provided on which techniques are most suitable for different biomechanical investigations. Finally, some predictions about how new ultrasound imaging technologies might continue to advance our understanding of human motion are proposed and explored.},

Magnetic Resonance Elastography has shown outstanding ability to measure the elasticity and in some cases the viscosity of tissues, especially in the liver, providing the ability to stage fibrotic liver disease similarly to biopsy. We discuss ultrasound methods of measuring elasticity and viscosity in tissues. Many of these methods are becoming widely available in the extant ultrasound machines distributed throughout the world. Some of the methods to be discussed are in the developmental stage. The advantages of the ultrasound methods are that the imaging instruments are widely available and that many of the viscoelastic measurements can be made during a short addition to the normal ultrasound examination time. In addition, the measurements can be made by ultrasound repetitively and quickly allowing evaluation of dynamic physiologic function in circumstances such as muscle contraction or artery relaxation. Measurement of viscoelastic tissue mechanical properties will become a consistent part of clinical ultrasound examinations in our opinion.},

This paper presents the first powered biarticular transtibial prosthesis, which is a combination of a commercial powered ankle-foot prosthesis and a motorized robotic knee orthosis. The orthosis is controlled to emulate the human gastrocnemius based on neuromuscular models of matched nonamputees. Together with the ankle-foot prosthesis, the devices provide biarticular actuation. We evaluate differences between this biarticular condition and a monoarticular condition with the orthosis behaving as a free-joint. Six participants with transtibial amputation walk with the prosthesis on a treadmill while motion, force, and metabolic data are collected and analyzed for differences between conditions. The biarticular prosthesis reduces affected-side biological knee flexion moment impulse and hip positive work during late-stance knee flexion, compared to the monoarticular condition. The data do not support our hypothesis that metabolism decreases for all participants, but some participants demonstrate large metabolic reductions with the biarticular condition. These preliminary results suggest that a powered artificial gastrocnemius may be capable of providing large metabolic reductions compared to a monoarticular prosthesis, but further study is warranted to determine an appropriate controller for achieving more consistent metabolic benefits.},

  abstract = {An accurate model for ElectroMyoGram (EMG)-torque dynamics has many uses. One of its applications which has gained high attention among researchers is its use, in estimating the muscle contraction level for the efficient control of prosthesis. In this paper, the dynamic relationship between the surface EMG and torque during isometric contractions at the human ankle was studied using system identification techniques. Subjects voluntarily modulated their ankle torque in dorsiflexion direction, by activating their tibialis anterior muscle, while tracking a pseudo-random binary sequence in a torque matching task. The effects of contraction bandwidth, described by torque spectrum, on EMG-torque dynamics were evaluated by varying the visual command switching time. Nonparametric impulse response functions (IRF) were estimated between the processed surface EMG and torque. It was demonstrated that: 1) at low contraction bandwidths, the identified IRFs had unphysiological anticipatory (i.e., non-causal) components, whose amplitude decreased as the contraction bandwidth increased. We hypothesized that this non-causal behavior arose, because the EMG input contained a component due to feedback from the output torque, i.e., it was recorded from within a closed-loop. Vision was not the feedback source since the non-causal behavior persisted when visual feedback was removed. Repeating the identification using a nonparametric closed-loop identification algorithm yielded causal IRFs at all bandwidths, supporting this hypothesis. 2) EMG-torque dynamics became faster and the bandwidth of system increased as contraction modulation rate increased. Thus, accurate prediction of torque from EMG signals must take into account the contraction bandwidth sensitivity of this system.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread availability of ultrasound and a need for personalised muscle diagnosis (neck/back pain-injury, work related disorder, myopathies, neuropathies), robust, online segmentation of muscles within complex groups remains unsolved by existing methods. For example, Cervical Dystonia (CD) is a prevalent neurological condition causing painful spasticity in one or multiple muscles in the cervical muscle system. Clinicians currently have no method for targeting/monitoring treatment of deep muscles. Automated methods of muscle segmentation would enable clinicians to study, target, and monitor the deep cervical muscles via ultrasound. We have developed a method for segmenting five bilateral cervical muscles and the spine via ultrasound alone, in real-time. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound data were collected from 22 participants (age: 29.0$\pm$6.6, male: 12). To acquire ultrasound muscle segment labels, a novel multimodal registration method was developed, involving MRI image annotation, and shape registration to MRI-matched ultrasound images, via approximation of the tissue deformation. We then applied polynomial regression to transform our annotations and textures into a mean space, before using shape statistics to generate a texture-to-shape dictionary. For segmentation, test images were compared to dictionary textures giving an initial segmentation, and then we used a customized Active Shape Model to refine the fit. Using ultrasound alone, on unseen participants, our technique currently segments a single image in \$$\backslash$approx 0.45$\backslash$text s\$ to over 86\% accuracy (Jaccard index). We propose this approach is applicable generally to segment, extrapolate and visualise deep muscle structure, and analyse statistical features online.},

  abstract = {Continuous measurement of contractile length has been traditionally achieved using animal preparations in which the muscle and tendon are exposed. More modern methods, e.g., sonomicroscopy, are still invasive. There is a widely perceived need for a noninvasive, in vivo method of measuring continuous changes of human muscle contractile length. Ultrasonography has been used for several years to measure relatively static, discrete changes in tendon, aponeurosis, and muscle fascicle length. We have recently developed this technique to continuously track changes in muscle contractile length during quiet standing. Here, we present the tracking algorithm and use externally applied perturbations to establish the spatial and temporal resolution of the technique. Subjects maintained a low level of ankle torque while a pneumatic actuator applied rapid, square-pulse ankle rotations of defined magnitude and 0.2-s duration. Tracked changes in gastrocnemius and soleus contractile length follow the temporal profile of the perturbations and scale progressively (5\textendash{}400 $\mu$m) with the size of the ankle rotation (0.03\textendash{}0.7$^\circ$). In a second experiment, we tracked a wire oscillating in water with known peak to peak amplitudes of 1.5 $\mu$m to 8 mm. The ultrasound tracking procedure had near 100\% accuracy at all amplitudes for frequencies up to 3 Hz and showed attenuation at higher frequencies consistent with an effective sampling frequency of 12 Hz and sampling time of 80 ms. This noninvasive technique is sensitive, without averaging, to changes as small as 1 $\mu$m and is suitable for observing neuromotor activity in posture and locomotion.},

Dynamic measurements of human muscle fascicle length from sequences of B-mode ultrasound images have become increasingly prevalent in biomedical research. Manual digitisation of these images is time consuming and algorithms for automating the process have been developed. Here we present a freely available software implementation of a previously validated algorithm for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicle length in dynamic ultrasound image recordings, ``UltraTrack''.
Methods
UltraTrack implements an affine extension to an optic flow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout dynamically recorded sequences of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of file formats.
Results
Two example runs of the software are presented detailing the tracking of fascicles from several lower limb muscles during a squatting and walking activity.
Conclusion
We have presented a software implementation of a validated fascicle-tracking algorithm and made the source code and standalone versions freely available for download.},

  abstract = {Background
This study was to extend previous neuromusculoskeletal modeling efforts through combining the in vivo ultrasound-measured musculotendon parameters on persons after stroke.
Method
A subject-specific neuromusculoskeletal model of the elbow was developed to predict the individual muscle force during dynamic movement and then validated by joint trajectory. The model combined a geometrical model and a Hill-type musculotendon model, and used subject-specific musculotendon parameters as inputs. EMG signals and joint angle were recorded from healthy control subjects (n=4) and persons after stroke (n=4) during voluntary elbow flexion in a vertical plane. Ultrasonography was employed to measure the muscle optimal length and pennation angle of each prime elbow flexor (biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis) and extensor (three heads of triceps brachii). Maximum isometric muscle stresses of the flexor and extensor muscle group were calibrated by minimizing the root mean square difference between the predicted and measured maximum isometric torque\textendash{}angle curves. These parameters were then inputted into the neuromusculoskeletal model to predict the individual muscle force using the input of EMG signals directly without any trajectory fitting procedure involved.
Findings
The results showed that the prediction of voluntary flexion in the hemiparetic group using subject-specific parameters data was better than that using cadaveric data extracted from the literature.
Interpretation
The results demonstrated the feasibility of using EMG-driven neuromusculoskeletal modeling with direct ultrasound measurement for the prediction of voluntary elbow movement for both subjects without impairment and persons after stroke.},

  abstract = {To investigate the ability of ultrasonography to estimate muscle activity, we measured architectural parameters (pennation angles, fascicle lengths, and muscle thickness) of several human muscles (tibialis anterior, biceps brachii, brachialis, transversus abdominis, obliquus internus abdominis, and obliquus externus abdominis) during isometric contractions of from 0 to 100\% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Concurrently, electromyographic (EMG) activity was measured with surface (tibialis anterior only) or fine-wire electrodes. Most architectural parameters changed markedly with contractions up to 30\% MVC but changed little at higher levels of contraction. Thus, ultrasound imaging can be used to detect low levels of muscle activity but cannot discriminate between moderate and strong contractions. Ultrasound measures could reliably detect changes in EMG of as little as 4\% MVC (biceps muscle thickness), 5\% MVC (brachialis muscle thickness), or 9\% MVC (tibialis anterior pennation angle). They were generally less sensitive to changes in abdominal muscle activity, but it was possible to reliably detect contractions of 12\% MVC in transversus abdominis (muscle length) and 22\% MVC in obliquus internus (muscle thickness). Obliquus externus abdominis thickness did not change consistently with muscle contraction, so ultrasound measures of thickness cannot be used to detect activity of this muscle. Ultrasound imaging can thus provide a noninvasive method of detecting isometric muscle contractions of certain individual muscles. Muscle Nerve 27: 682\textendash{}692, 2003},

Thus the relative contributions of tendon, aponeurosis, and fascicle to muscle-tendon unit compliance remain to be determined. The present study analyzed the dynamic interactions of fascicle, tendon, and aponeurosis in human gastrocnemius medialis during the first milliseconds of an ankle quick-release movement, using high-frame-rate ultrasonography (2,000 frames/s). Nine subjects performed the tests in random order at six levels of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) (30\% to 80\% of MVC). These tests were carried out with the ultrasound probe placed on the muscle belly and on the myotendinous junction. Tendon, muscle fascicle, and aponeurosis length changes were quantified in relation to shortening of the muscletendon unit during the first few milliseconds following the release. The tendon was the main contributor (around 72\%) to the shortening of the muscle-tendon unit, whereas the muscle fascicle and aponeurosis contributions were 18\% and 10\%, respectively. Because these structures can be considered in series, the quantified contributions can be regarded as relative contributions to muscle-tendon compliance. These contributions were not modified with the level of MVC or the time range used for the analysis between 10 and 25 ms. The constant contribution of tendon, muscle fascicle, and aponeurosis to muscletendon unit compliance may help to simplify the mechanism of compliance regulation and to maintain the important role of tendons in enhancing work output and movement efficiency.

  abstract = {During human standing, tonic ankle extensor torque is required to support the centre of mass (CoM) forward of the ankles, and dynamic torque modulation is required to maintain unstable balance. Passive mechanisms contribute to both but the extent is controversial. Some groups have revealed a substantial intrinsic stiffness (65\textendash{}90\%) normalized to load stiffness, `mgh'. Others regard their methodology as unsuitable for the low-frequency conditions of quiet standing and believe the passive contribution to be small (10\textendash{}15\%). Here we applied low-frequency ankle rotations to upright subjects who were supported at the waist allowing the leg muscles to be passive and we report normalized stiffness. The passive calf muscles provided: (i) an extensor torque capable of sustaining unstable balance without tonic activity at a mean CoM\textendash{}ankle angle of 1.6 deg, (ii) a long range stiffness of 13 $\pm$ 2\% and (iii) a short range ($<$ 0.2 deg) stiffness of 67 $\pm$ 8\%. Chordal ankle stiffness, derived from the torque versus angle relationship for 7 deg rotations, shows a non-linear decrease (stiffness $\alpha$ rotation-0.33$\pm$0.04) from 101 $\pm$ 9\% to 19 $\pm$ 5\% for rotations of 0.03\textendash{}7 deg, respectively. Thus, passive stiffness is well adapted for the continuum of postural and movement activity and has a substantial postural role eliminating the need for continuous muscle activity and increasing the unstable time constant of the human inverted pendulum. Ignoring the non-linear dependence of passive stiffness on sway size could lead to serious misinterpretation of experiments using perturbations and sensory manipulations such as eye closure, sway referencing and altered support surfaces.},

  abstract = {In humans, one of the most common tasks in everyday life is walking, and sensory afferent feedback from peripheral receptors, particularly the muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs (GTO), makes an important contribution to the motor control of this task. One factor that can complicate the ability of these receptors to act as length, velocity and force transducers is the complex pattern of interaction between muscle and tendinous tissues, as tendon length is often considerably greater than muscle fibre length in the human lower limb. In essence, changes in muscle\textendash{}tendon mechanics can influence the firing behaviour of afferent receptors, which may in turn affect the motor control. In this review we first summarise research that has incorporated the use of ultrasound-based techniques to study muscle\textendash{}tendon interaction, predominantly during walking. We then review recent research that has combined this method with an examination of muscle activation to give a broader insight to neuromuscular interaction during walking. Despite the advances in understanding that these techniques have brought, there is clearly still a need for more direct methods to study both neural and mechanical parameters during human walking in order to unravel the vast complexity of this seemingly simple task.},

Eleven male adults (23.9 7 2.2 yr) participated in the study. The participants exercised one leg at low magnitude tendon strain (2.97 7 0.47\%), and the other leg at high tendon strain magnitude (4.72 71.08\%) of similar frequency (0.5 Hz, 1 s loading, 1 s relaxation) and exercise volume (integral of the plantar flexion moment over time) for 14 weeks, 4 days per week, 5 sets per session. The exercise volume was similar to the intervention of our earlier study (0.17 Hz frequency; 3 s loading, 3 s relaxation) allowing a direct comparison of the results. Before and after the intervention ankle joint moment has been measured by a dynamometer, tendon\textendash{}aponeurosis elongation by ultrasound and cross-sectional area of the Achilles tendon by magnet resonance images (MRI). We found a decrease in strain at a given tendon force, an increase in tendon\textendash{}aponeurosis stiffness and tendon elastic modulus of the Achilles tendon only in the leg exercised at high strain magnitude. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the Achilles tendon did not show any statistically significant (P 4 0.05) differences to the pre-exercise values in both legs. The results indicate a superior improvement in tendon properties (stiffness, elastic modulus and CSA) at the low frequency (0.17 Hz) compared to the high strain frequency (0.5 Hz) protocol. These findings provide evidence that the strain magnitude applied to the Achilles tendon should exceed the value, which occurs during habitual activities to trigger adaptational effects and that higher tendon strain duration per contraction leads to superior tendon adaptational responses.},

The Achilles is a long tendon varying in cross-sectional area (CSA) considerably along its length. For the same force, a smaller CSA would experience higher tendon stress and we hypothesised that these areas would therefore undergo larger transverse deformations. A novel magnetic resonance imaging-based approach was implemented to quantify changes in tendon CSA from rest along the length of the Achilles tendon under load conditions corresponding to 10\%, 20\% and 30\% of isometric plantar flexor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Reductions in tendon CSA occurring during contraction from the resting condition were assumed to be proportional to the longitudinal elongations within those regions (Poisson's ratio). Rather than tendon regions of smallest CSA undergoing the greatest deformations, the outcome was region specific, with the proximal (gastrocnemius) tendon portion showing larger transverse deformations upon loading compared with the distal portion of the Achilles (P$<$0.01). Transverse tendon deformation only occurred in selected regions of the distal Achilles tendon at 20\% and 30\% of MVC, but in contrast occurred throughout the proximal portion of the Achilles at all contraction levels (10\%, 20\% and 30\% of MVC; P$<$0.01). Calculations showed that force on the proximal tendon portion was $\sim$60\% lower, stress $\sim$70\% lower, stiffness $\sim$30\% lower and Poisson's ratio 6-fold higher compared with those for the distal portion of the Achilles tendon. These marked regional differences in mechanical properties may allow the proximal portion to function as a mechanical buffer to protect the stiffer, more highly stressed, distal portion of the Achilles tendon from injury.},

  abstract = {Significant changes in extrafusal fiber type composition take place in the human masseter muscle from young age, 3\textendash{}7 years, to adulthood, in parallel with jaw-face skeleton growth, changes of dentitions and improvement of jaw functions. As motor and sensory control systems of muscles are interlinked, also the intrafusal fiber population, that is, muscle spindles, should undergo age-related changes in fiber type appearance. To test this hypothesis, we examined muscle spindles in the young masseter muscle and compared the result with previous data on adult masseter spindles. Also muscle spindles in the young biceps brachii muscle were examined. The result showed that muscle spindle composition and distribution were alike in young and adult masseter. As for the adult masseter, young masseter contained exceptionally large muscle spindles, and with the highest spindle density and most complex spindles found in the deep masseter portion. Hence, contrary to our hypothesis, masseter spindles do not undergo major morphological changes between young age and adulthood. Also in the biceps, young spindles were alike adult spindles. Taken together, the results showed that human masseter and biceps muscle spindles are morphologically mature already at young age. We conclude that muscle spindles in the human young masseter and biceps precede the extrafusal fiber population in growth and maturation. This in turn suggests early reflex control and proprioceptive demands in learning and maturation of jaw motor skills. Similarly, well-developed muscle spindles in young biceps reflect early need of reflex control in learning and performing arm motor behavior. Anat Rec, 294:683\textendash{}693, 2011.

  abstract = {Summary
Through recent studies, the role of proprioceptors in reactions to perturbations during gait has been finally somewhat better understood. The input from spindle afferents has been investigated with tendon taps, vibration and other forms of muscle stretches, including some resembling natural perturbations (stumbling, slips, and ankle inversions). It was found that activation of spindle afferents produces short-latency response (SLR), consistent with a fast spinal pathway. These reflexes induce relatively minor activation in the stretched muscles. A central question is whether stretch reflexes can occur for stimuli that are quite remote. Thus, a new study was made to examine whether foot sole vibration is able to elicit reflex responses in upper-leg muscles, for example by conduction of vibrations throughout the whole leg. SLR responses were indeed found not only in lower- but also in upper-leg muscles. Similarly during stumbling, SLR are observed throughout the whole limb, although the primary perturbation occurs at foot level. After the SLR, much stronger activations usually occur, with latencies (85 or 120ms) well below those seen in voluntary contractions. These late responses are much more selective and presumably linked to the maintenance of stability. The role of the Ib afferents from the Golgi tendon organs (GTO) is less clear. From animal work, it is known that these afferents are very sensitive to active muscle contraction and that they play a role in providing reinforcing feedback to extensors during the stance phase. The available evidence supports this notion in humans but lack of selective activation methods precludes more conclusive confirmation.
R\'esum\'e
Des \'etudes r\'ecentes ont permis finalement d'un peu mieux comprendre le r\^ole des propriocepteurs dans les r\'eactions aux perturbations pendant la locomotion. La fonction des aff\'erences Ia des fuseaux neuromusculaires a \'et\'e \'etudi\'ee gr\^ace \`a des vibrations tendineuses, diff\'erents types d'\'etirements musculaires, ainsi que par l'interm\'ediaire de quelques perturbations quasi \guillemotleft{}~normales~\guillemotright{} (tr\'ebuchement, glissades, inversions de cheville). On a constat\'e que l'activation des aff\'erences Ia produisait des r\'eflexes de courte-latence (SLR), par l'interm\'ediaire d'une voie spinale rapide. Ces r\'eflexes induisent une activation relativement mineure des muscles \'etir\'es, m\^eme lorsque la source de perturbation est tr\`es \'eloign\'ee. Par exemple, une \'etude r\'ecente indique qu'une vibration appliqu\'ee sur la plante du pied peut produire des r\'eponses r\'eflexes dans des muscles de la partie sup\'erieure de la jambe, vraisemblablement en raison de la transmission de la vibration \`a la jambe enti\`ere. De m\^eme, lorsque quelqu'un tr\'ebuche, il y a des SLR dans tout le membre, bien que la perturbation primaire se produise au niveau du pied. Apr\`es le SLR apparaissent habituellement des activations beaucoup plus fortes avec des latences (85ms) bien au-dessous de celles observ\'ees lors de contractions volontaires. Ces r\'eflexes de longue latence sont beaucoup plus s\'electifs et sont vraisemblablement destin\'es \`a l'entretien de la stabilit\'e. L'autre propriocepteur important est l'organe neurotendineux de Golgi (OTG), situ\'e \`a la jonction du tendon et du muscle. Son r\^ole et celui des aff\'erences Ib est moins clair. On sait sur base de donn\'ees animales que ces aff\'erences sont tr\`es sensibles au sein du muscle actif et qu'elles jouent un r\^ole de renforcement de la contraction des extenseurs pendant la phase d'appui (r\'eflexe de r\'esistance). L'\'evidence disponible soutient cette notion chez l'homme mais le manque de m\'ethodes d'activation s\'elective emp\^eche de confirmer r\'eellement cette id\'ee.},

  abstract = {Utilization of elastic energy in the tendinous tissues (TT) of the human skeletal muscle may be task dependent. The present study was designed to investigate this problem by comparing the fascicle-TT interaction of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (MG) during ground contact of running and walking. Seven subjects ran and walked with a natural cadence. Ankle and knee joint angular data were recorded by electrogoniometers for estimating the entire MG muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length, together with the ground reaction forces. The MG fascicle length was measured by using the high-speed ultrasound image scanning during movements. The results showed that in running, after the rapid early fascicle stretching (0\textendash{}10\% of the contact period), the fascicles shortened throughout the ground contact while TT was stretched prior to shortening. In walking, the fascicles shortened initially (0\textendash{}15\% of the contact period) due to sudden plantar-flexion. Thereafter, the fascicles and TT lengthened slowly until the end of single support (15\textendash{}70\% of the contact period.). The fascicles then shorted during the push-off phase (70\textendash{}100\% of the contact period). These results demonstrate that the MG fascicles behaved differently between running and walking and did not follow the length change pattern of the MTU during the ground contact period. The estimated working range of active muscle fibers in force\textendash{}length relationship could shift more to an ascending limb (shorter length) phase in running than in walking. These results suggest that MG fascicles can work within the optimal working range of the sarcomeres in the force\textendash{}length relation but are responsible for the effective utilization of the TT elasticity during human running.},

  abstract = {This is a table of skeletal muscles of the human anatomy.
There are over 600 skeletal muscles within the typical human body. Almost every muscle constitutes one part of a pair of identical bilateral muscles, found on both sides, resulting in approximately 320 pairs of muscles, as presented
in this article. Nevertheless, the exact number is difficult to define because different sources group muscles differently, e.g. regarding what is defined as different parts of a single muscle or as several muscles.
The muscles of the human body can be categorized into a number of groups which include muscles relating to the head and neck, muscles of the torso or trunk, muscles of the upper limbs, and muscles of the lower limbs.
The action refers to the action of each muscle from the standard anatomical position. In other positions, other actions may be performed.
These muscles are described using anatomical terminology.},
